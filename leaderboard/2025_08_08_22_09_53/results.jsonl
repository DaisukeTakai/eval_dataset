So, we only need\nto prove the inequalities for successive even index and successive\nodd index pairs, i.e. for every index $i > 2$ , prove $a_{i-2}a_i \\le 2i-2$ .\nWe now compare $a_ia_{i+2}/(2i+2)$ with $a_{i+2}a_{i+4}/(2i+6)$ .

{"id": "220", "category": null, "question": "Answer: $\\quad P(x)=\\frac{x\\left(x^{4 k+2}+1\\right)}{x^{2}+1}$ or $P(x)=\\frac{x\\left(1-x^{4 k}\\right)}{x^{2}+1}$ Solution: It is straightforward to plug in and verify the above answers. Hence, we focus on showing that these are all possible solutions. The key claim is the following. Claim: If $r \\neq 0$ is a root of $P(z)$ with multiplicity $n$, then $1 / r$ is also a root of $P(z)$ with multiplicity $n$. Proof 1 (Elementary). Let $n^{\\prime}$ be the multiplicity of $1 / r$. It suffices to show that $n \\leq n^{\\prime}$ because we can apply the same assertion on $1 / r$ to obtain that $n^{\\prime} \\leq n$. To that end, suppose that $(z-r)^{n}$ divides $P(z)$. From the equation, we have $$z^{N}\\left[P\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)+P(z)\\right]=z^{N}\\left[\\left(z+\\frac{1}{z}\\right) P(z) P\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)\\right]$$ where $N \\gg \\operatorname{deg} P+1$ to guarantee that both sides are polynomial. Notice that the factor $z^{N} P(z)$ and the right-hand side is divisible by $(z-r)^{n}$, so $(z-r)^{n}$ must also divide $z^{N} P\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)$. This means that there exists a polynomial $Q(z)$ such that $z^{N} P\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)=(z-r)^{n} Q(z)$. Replacing $z$ with $\\frac{1}{z}$, we get $$\\frac{P(z)}{z^{N}}=\\left(\\frac{1}{z}-r\\right)^{n} Q\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right) \\Longrightarrow P(z)=z^{N-n}(1-r z)^{n} Q\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)$$ implying that $P(z)$ is divisible by $(z-1 / r)^{n}$. Proof 2 (Complex Analysis). Here is more advanced proof of the main claim. View both sides of the equations as meromorphic functions in the complex plane. Then, a root $r$ with multiplicity $n$ of $P(z)$ is a pole of $\\frac{1}{P(z)}$ of order $n$. Since the right-hand side is analytic around $r$, it follows that the other term $\\frac{1}{P(1 / z)}$ has a pole at $r$ with order $n$ as well. By replacing $z$ with $1 / z$, we find that $\\frac{1}{P(z)}$ has a pole at $1 / r$ of order $n$. This finishes the claim. The claim implies that there exists an integer $k$ and a constant $\\epsilon$ such that $$P(z)=\\epsilon z^{k} P\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)$$ By replacing $z$ with $1 / z$, we get that $$z^{k} P\\left(\\frac{1}{z}\\right)=\\epsilon P(z)$$ Therefore, $\\epsilon= \\pm 1$. Moreover, using the main equation, we get that $$\\frac{1}{P(z)}+\\frac{\\epsilon z^{k}}{P(z)}=z+\\frac{1}{z} \\Longrightarrow P(z)=\\frac{z\\left(1+\\epsilon z^{k}\\right)}{1+z^{2}}$$ This is a polynomial if and only if $(\\epsilon=1$ and $k \\equiv 2(\\bmod 4))$ or $(\\epsilon=-1$ and $k \\equiv 0(\\bmod 4))$, so we are done.", "user_prompt": "", "answer_type": null, "prediction": "P(x)=\\frac{x\\left(x^{4k+2}+1\\right)}{x^{2}+1} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad P(x)=\\frac{x\\left(1-x^{4k}\\right)}{x^{2}+1}", "gold": "\\[ P(x) = \\frac{x\\left(x^{4k+2}+1\\right)}{x^{2}+1} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad P(x) = \\frac{x\\left(1-x^{4k}\\right)}{x^{2}+1} \\]", "correct": 1, "judgement": "The extracted_final_answer matches the [correct_answer] exactly.

To prove the lower bound, note that by the triangle inequality, $A B+B C>A C$ and $A D+D C>A C$, so $S=A B+B C+A D+D C>2 A C$. Similarly, $S>2 B D$, so $2 S>2 A C+2 B D=2 D$ gives $S>D$. To prove the upper bound, note that again by the triangle inequality, $A E+E B>A B, C E+B E>B C, A E+E D>A D, C E+E D>C D$. Adding these yields $2(A E+E C+B E+E D)>A B+B C+A D+C D=S$. Now since $A B C D$ is convex, $E$ is inside the quadrilateral, so $A E+E C=A C$ and $B E+E D=B D$. Thus $2(A C+B D)=D>S$. To achieve every real value in this range, first consider a square $A B C D$. This has $\\frac{S}{D}=\\sqrt{2}$.

Let there also be 28 pairs that include the negatives of those numbers such that each negative associates with another negative once and exactly once (in graph theoretic terms, a K8). Let x be the number of positives chosen out of these 8 (assume the other chosen numbers are negatives) for erasing; then, the number of points the student scores is $28 + 5x - {x \\choose 2}$ , which is maximized at x=5 and x=6, and the maximum value is $43$ . Choosing the first 5 numbers as positive and the other three as negative attains this. Hence, 43 is a possible maximum possible score.\n \nBounding: We use expected values. WLOG all the pairs of numbers with both numbers identical have only positive values. Consider flipping a weighted coin whether to choose the positive number or its negation for each positive number; it chooses positive with probability p. The pairs with both numbers same are chosen with probability p, the pairs (k, -k) are chosen with probability 1, and the pairs (x, y) for distinct x and y that sum to a nonzero number are chosen with probability $1-p^2$ .

The expected number of points scored is $Ap + (68-A)(1-p^2)$ . We want to prove this is larger than 42 at all times for some choice of p. If $A < 36$ , $1/2$ works for p to give this bound. If $A > 36$ , $5/8$ works for p for p to give the desired bound. If $A = 36$ , we can use $3/5$ for p to get the desired bound. Hence, in any case, the expected value for the number of points scored across all of these weighted processes is larger than 42, so there exists some case that gives a score of 43.

We color a tile R if its row and column are odd, a tile G is its row is even but its column is odd, a tile B if its row and column is even, and a tile Y if its row is odd but its column is even.\nLemma 1: Throughout our moves, the color of the uncolored tile stays an invariant.\nConsider that a domino can either only change rows or can only change columns. Therefore, sliding a domino into the hole and creating a new one has two possible colors. Of these, note that the new hole will always trivially be two tiles away from the old hole, meaning that the parity of both the row and column number stays the same. Thus, the lemma holds.\nLemma 2: There are more red tiles than any other color. \nBecause each color is uniquely defined by the parity of a pair of column and row number, it satisfies to show that given an odd integer $n$ , there are more odd positive integers less than or equal to $n$ than even ones. Obviously, this is true, and so red will have more tiles than any other color.\nLemma 3: For any starting configuration $C$ and any blank tile $B$ such that the blank tile's color matches the blank tile's color of $C$ , there is no more than one unique configuration $C'$ that can be produced from $C$ using valid moves.\nWe will use proof by contradiction. Assume there exists two different $C'$ . We can get from one of these $C'$ to another using moves. However, we have to finish off with the same hole as before. Before the last move, the hole must be two tiles away from the starting hole. However, because the domino we used to move into the blank tile's spot is in the way, that hole must be congruent to the hole produced after the first move. We can induct this logic, and because there is a limited amount of tiles with the same color, eventually we will run out of tiles to apply this to. Therefore, having two distinct $C'$ with the same starting hole $B$ is impossible with some $C$ .\nWe will now prove that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is the answer. There are $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ rows and $\\frac{n+1}{2}$ columns that are odd, and thus there are $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ red tiles. Given lemma 3, this is our upper bound for a maximum.

Then, continuously fill in  vertically oriented dominos in that column until it reaches the bottom.\nIn the next $n-1$ columns, place $\\frac{n-1}{2}$ vertically oriented dominos in a row starting from the top. At the bottom row, starting with the first unfilled tile on the left, place horizontally aligned dominos in a row until you reach the right.\nObviously, the top left tile is red. It suffices to show that any red tile may be uncovered. For the first column, one may slide some dominos on the first column until the desired tile is uncovered. For the bottom row, all the first dominos may be slid up, and then the bottom dominos may be slid to the left until the desired red tile is uncovered. Finally, for the rest of the red tiles, the bottom red tile in the same color may be revealed, and then vertically aligned dominos in the same column may be slid down until the desired tile is revealed. Therefore, this configuration may produce $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ different configurations with moves.\nHence, we have proved that $(\\frac{n+1}{2})^2$ is the maximum, and we are done. $\\blacksquare{}$ \n~SigmaPiE\n ", "user_prompt": "", "answer_type": null, "prediction": "\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)^2", "gold": "\\[\n\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)^2\n\\]", "correct": 1, "judgement": "The extracted_final_answer exactly matches the [correct_answer] in both mathematical expression and formatting.

Now, let $y = m$ and we get: \\[m^2f(4k - m^2) = f(m^3)\\] Now, either both sides are 0 or both are equal to $m^6$ . If both are $m^6$ then: \\[m^2(4k - m^2)^2 = m^6\\] which simplifies to: \\[4k - m^2 = \\pm m^2\\] Since $k \\neq 0$ and $m$ is odd, both cases are impossible, so we must have: \\[m^2f(4k - m^2) = f(m^3) = 0\\] Then we can let $k$ be anything except 0, and get $f(x)$ is 0 for all $x \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4}$ except $-m^2$ .

Since $f(m) \\neq 0$ , $m = \\pm m^2$ . Squaring, $m^2 = m^4$ and dividing by $m$ , $m = m^3$ . Since $f(m^3) = 0$ , $f(m) = 0$ , which is a contradiction for $m \\neq 1$ . However, if we plug in $x = 1$ with $f(1) = 1$ and $y$ as an arbitrary large number with $f(y) = 0$ into the original equation, we get $0 = 1$ which is a clear contradiction, so our only solutions are $f(x) = 0$ and $f(x) = x^2$ .", "user_prompt": "", "answer_type": null, "prediction": "\\boxed{f(x) = 0} and \\boxed{f(x) = x^2}", "gold": "The functions that satisfy the given equation are:\n\\[ f(x) = 0 \\]\nand\n\\[ f(x) = x^2 \\]", "correct": 1, "judgement": "The extracted_final_answer exactly matches the [correct_answer], which also states that the solutions are $ f(x) = 0 $ and $ f(x) = x^2 $.

Solving the inequality and making the left side 0, we get $0\\geq a^2-6a-18=(a+3)(a-6)$ . If the quadratic is greater than 0, it means that the RHS will be too large for any $a$ to suffice because we have already chosen the minimum value for the RHS and the maximum for the LHS.

{"id": "263", "category": null, "question": "I claim that the only function $f$ that satisfies the constraints outlined within the problem is the function $f(n) = 1$ for all positive integers $n$ .\nWe will proceed with strong induction. The base case is simple, as plugging $a=1$ into the second equation given within the problem gives $f(1)=f(1)^2$ . Since $f(n)$ can only return a positive integer value, we have that $f(1)=1$ .\nNow we proceed with the inductive step. If the next number $n$ is either a perfect square or can be represented as a sum of two perfect squares, then obviously $f(n)=1$ , as it is either the product of two $f$ -values that are both equal to $1$ from the inductive assumption or is the square of an $f$ -value that is equal to $1$ , again due to the inductive assumption. Otherwise, we can use the Sum of Two Squares Theorem, which tells us that $n$ has at least one prime in its prime factorization that is $3(\\mod 4)$ and is raised to an odd power.\nLemma 1: Given that $a^2+b^2=c^2$ and $f(b)=f(c)=1$ , we then have $f(a)=1$ .\nProof: Note that the first condition in the problem tells us that $f(a^2+b^2)=f(a)f(b)$ , or $f(c^2)=f(a)f(b)$ . Using the second condition gives us $f(c)^2=f(a)f(b)$ . Plugging in the values of $f(b)$ and $f(c)$ gives us that $f(a)=1$ .\nNow we will attempt to repeatedly remove prime factors that are $3(mod 4)$ and taken to an odd power, and we will move from the largest prime down to the smallest prime that satisfies above conditions. The prime factors will be removed by constructing a Pythagorean Triple with the prime being the smallest leg in the form of $p,\\frac{p^2-1}{2},\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$ (this will always work as $p\\neq 2$ (not 3 mod 4), and this method works via Lemma 1). We will then prove the ending numbers that we achieve via removing all the $(\\text{mod } 4)$ primes(which I will refer to as \"tips\") are equal to 1 b/c they can be expressed as the sum of two squares or is a perfect square(Sum of Two Squares Theorem). For example, if we took the number $21$ , we would first aim to remove the $7$ by splitting it into $24$ and $25$ , so $21$ would become $72$ and $75$ . $75$ is divisible by $3$ to an odd power, so we transform it into $100$ and $125$ . These two don't have any divisors that are $3 (\\text{mod } 4)$ raised to an odd power so we leave it alone, as sum of two squares will work on them or they are perfect squares. $72$ does have a prime factor that is $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ , but it is an even power so we leave it alone. In this case, the tips are $72$ , $100$ , and $125$ . However, now we need to prove two key facts: using this Pythagorean Triple Method will never generate another $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ prime that is bigger than the current one we are working on or create more primes or keep the same number of primes in the tips' prime factorizations., as otherwise it could cause an infinite cycle, and also we must prove when we use Sum of Two Squares/Perfect Square given in the second condition on the tips the square root of the square(s) used will never be greater than or equal to $n$ .\nThe first claim can be proved rather simply. Note that $\\frac{p^2-1}{2}$ can have no prime factors greater than or equal to $p$ , as it can be factored as $(p-1)(\\frac{p+1}{2})$ , which are both less than $p$ and are integers( $p+1$ must be an integer due to $p$ must being odd(not equal to $2$ )). For $\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$ , we can prove something a bit more general.\nLemma 2: For any positive integer $n$ , all prime factors of $n^2+1$ must be $1(\\text{mod } 4)$ .\nProof: Note that if $n^2+1\\equiv 0(\\text{mod } p)$ , then we also must have $(n^2+1)(n^2-1)=(n^4-1)\\equiv 0(\\text{mod } p)$ , or $n^4 \\equiv 1(\\text{mod } p)$ . Now we can apply Fermat's Little Theorem to obtain $n^{p-1}\\equiv 1(\\text{mod } p)$ . Note that since $n$ and $n^2$ are obviously not $1(\\text{mod } p)$ , as $n^2\\equiv -1 (\\text{mod } p)$ , we have that $p-1$ is a multiple of $4$ , or $p \\equiv 1(\\text{mod } 4)$ .\nWe can simply apply Lemma 2 to $p^2+1$ as $2$ is obviously not $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ , and this means that a prime factor $3(\\text{mod } 4)$ will never be generated from this term. This completes the first of our two claims.\nNow we proceed to the second of our two claims. Note that every time we use the method on $n$ based on prime $p$ , we will multiply by around $\\frac{p}{2}$ , clearly less than $p$ (if we multiply by $p$ we would get $p^2$ which is clearly greater than $\\frac{p^2+1}{2}$ ). We will never have to use the same prime twice in our method, so at max in the end we will multiply $n$ by the product of a little less than all $3(mod 4)$ primes that divide it, which is less than $n$ itself for $n$ greater than or equal to $3$ (the smallest 3 mod 4 prime), meaning that the largest number that we must use two squares on that is generated by out method is less than $n^2$ . We need to prove that the two squares that sum to this are both less than $n$ , which is quite trivial, as they are less than $\\sqrt{n^2}$ , which obviously means it must be less than $n$ . This proves the second of our claims.\nThis completes the second case of the inductive step, and therefore completes both the induction and the problem.\n~Solution by hyxue", "user_prompt": "", "answer_type": null, "prediction": "The only function satisfying the constraints is $ f(n) = 1 $ for all positive integers $ n $.", "gold": "The only function \\( f \\) that satisfies the given conditions is \\( f(n) = 1 \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\).", "correct": 1, "judgement": "The extracted_final_answer exactly matches the [correct_answer], as both state that the unique function $ f $ satisfying the conditions is $ f(n) = 1 $ for all positive integers $ n $.

{"id": "271", "category": null, "question": "We claim (inductively) that the minimum is just going to be $\\min(BW,2WR,3RB)$ . We'll start our induction with the case where one of the three quantities is zero, in which case we verify that we can indeed get away without any penalty by, for example, discarding blue if we are out of white.\nNow, for the inductive step, let $f(B,W,R)$ be the minimum we seek. Note that \\[f(B,W,R) = \\min(W+f(B-1,W,R),2R+f(B,W-1,R),3B+f(B,W,R-1))\\] By our inductive hypothesis, $f(B-1,W,R) = \\min((B-1)W,2WR,3R(B-1))$ . In order for this to cause our inductive step not to hold, we would require that $W+\\min((B-1)W,2WR,3R(B-1)) < \\min(BW,2WR,3RB)$ . It is evident that the first two entries in the $min$ expression cannot cause this to happen, so that we need only consider $W+3R(B-1) < \\min(BW,2WR,3RB)$ . So $W+3R(B-1) < BW$ , whence $3R < W$ . But $W+3R(B-1) < 3RB$ , so that $W < 3R$ , a contradiction.\nFor the other two cases, we can get similar contradictions, so that our inductive step must hold, and so $f(B,W,R)$ is indeed $\\min(BW,2WR,3RB)$ .\nWe now need only establish how many ways to do this. If one of these quantities is smaller, our induction and the fact that it is eventually zero guarantees that it will continue to be the smallest quantity as cards are discarded. (For example, if it is currently optimal to discard a blue card, it will continue to be so until we run out of blue cards.) Therefore, assuming that there is currently only one best choice of card to discard, this will continue to be so in the future, whence if $BW \\neq 2WR \\neq 3RB$ , there is only $1$ optimal strategy.\nSuppose, now, that $BW = 2WR$ . It is thus optimal to discard either a $B$ or $W$ card. If we ever discard a blue card, then we will cause $BW < 2WR$ , whence there is only one possible strategy from then on. However, if we discard a white card, then we will still have $BW = 2WR$ , meaning that we continue to have the choice of discarding a white or blue card. Since we can discard a white card at most $W$ times, there are $W+1$ choices for how many $W$ cards to discard ( $0$ to $W$ ), meaning that there are $W+1$ optimal strategies.\nBy similar logic, we get $R+1$ optimal strategies if $2WR = 3RB$ , and $B+1$ optimal strategies if $3RB = BW$ .\nThe final case, then, is if $BW = 2WR = 3RB$ . In this case, if we first discard a white card, we are left with the $BW = 2WR$ case, and similarly for a blue and red card. The total number of optimal strategies in this case is then the sum of the optimal strategies in those cases, or, in other words, $B+W+R$ .\nTo summarize:\nThe minimum penalty is $\\min(BW,2WR,3RB)$ .\nIf $BW \\neq 2WR \\neq 3RB$ , there is $1$ optimal strategy.\nIf $BW = 2WR < 3RB$ , there are $W+1$ strategies.\nIf $2WR = 3RB < BW$ , there are $R+1$ strategies.\nIf $3RB = BW < 2WR$ , there are $B+1$ strategies.\nIf $BW = 2WR = 3RB$ , there are $R+B+W$ strategies.\nBy J Steinhardt, from AoPS Community", "user_prompt": "", "answer_type": null, "prediction": "B + W + R", "gold": "The minimal total penalty a player can amass is:\n\\[ \\min(BW, 2WR, 3RB) \\]\n\nThe number of optimal strategies is:\n- If \\( BW \\neq 2WR \\neq 3RB \\), there is \\( 1 \\) optimal strategy.\n- If \\( BW = 2WR < 3RB \\), there are \\( W+1 \\) strategies.\n- If \\( 2WR = 3RB < BW \\), there are \\( R+1 \\) strategies.\n- If \\( 3RB = BW < 2WR \\), there are \\( B+1 \\) strategies.\n- If \\( BW = 2WR = 3RB \\), there are \\( R+B+W \\) strategies.", "correct": 1, "judgement": "The response correctly identifies that when all three quantities $BW = 2WR = 3RB$ are equal, the number of optimal strategies is $B + W + R$.

For each $i$ we consider the quadrilateral formed by the segments $A_{i} M_{i}$ and $A_{i} M_{i-1}$ and the perpendiculars to this segments drawn through $M_{i}$ and $M_{i-1}$, respectively. We claim that these $n$ quadrilateral cover the $n$-gon. Indeed, let $P$ be a point inside the $n$-gon. Let $P A_{k}$ be the minimum among the distances $P A_{1}, P A_{2}, \\ldots, P A_{n}$. We have $P A_{k} \\leqslant P A_{k+1}$ and $P A_{k} \\leqslant P A_{k-11}$, therefore $P$ belongs to the $n$-gon and to each of the two half-planes containing $A_{k}$ and bounded by the perpendicular bisectors to $A_{k} A_{k+1}$ and $A_{k} A_{k-11}$, that is, to the $k$-th quadrilateral. To complete the proof it remains to note that the area of the $i$-th quadrilateral does nor exceed $\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{A_{i-1} A_{i+1}}{2} \\cdot R_{i}$. For our problem it follows that $4 S \\leqslant 2 R_{1}^{2} \\sin \\angle A_{1}+2 R_{2}^{2} \\sin \\angle A_{2}+\\ldots+2 R_{5}^{2} \\sin \\angle A_{5}$. Applying Cauchy-Buniakowsky inequality, we obtain $2 S \\leqslant R_{1}^{2} \\sin \\angle A_{1}+R_{2}^{2} \\sin \\angle A_{2}+\\ldots+R_{5}^{2} \\sin \\angle A_{5} \\leqslant \\sqrt{\\left(R_{1}^{4}+\\ldots+R_{5}^{4}\\right)\\left(\\sin ^{2} \\angle A_{1}+\\ldots+\\sin ^{2} \\angle A_{5}\\right)} \\leqslant \\sqrt{5\\left(R_{1}^{4}+\\ldots+R_{5}^{4}\\right) \\sin ^{2} 108^{\\circ}}$ thus $\\frac{4 S^{2}}{5 \\sin ^{2} 108^{\\circ}} \\leqslant R_{1}^{4}+R_{2}^{4}+\\ldots+R_{5}^{4}$. In the above inequality we made use of the following Lemma 2. If $\\alpha_{1}, \\alpha_{2}, \\ldots, \\alpha_{5}$ are angles of a convex pentagon, then $\\sin ^{2} \\alpha_{1}+\\ldots+\\sin ^{2} \\alpha_{5} \\leqslant 5 \\sin ^{2} 108^{\\circ}$. The sum in question does not depend on the order of the angles, therefore we may assume $\\alpha_{1} \\leqslant \\alpha_{2} \\leqslant \\ldots \\leqslant \\alpha_{5}$. If $\\alpha_{1}=108^{\\circ}$, then $\\alpha_{2}=\\ldots=\\alpha_{5}=108^{\\circ}$, and the inequality turns to equality. If $\\alpha_{1}<108^{\\circ}$, then $\\alpha_{5}>108^{\\circ}$. Note that $\\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{5}<270^{\\circ}$ (if $\\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{5} \\geqslant 270^{\\circ}$, then $\\alpha_{2}+\\alpha_{3}+\\alpha_{4} \\leqslant 270^{\\circ}$, therefore $\\alpha_{2} \\leqslant 90^{\\circ}$, a fortiori $\\alpha_{1} \\leqslant 90^{\\circ}$ and thus $\\alpha_{5} \\geqslant 180^{\\circ}$, a contradiction). Then we have $\\sin ^{2} 108^{\\circ}+\\sin ^{2}\\left(\\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{5}-108^{\\circ}\\right)-\\sin ^{2} \\alpha_{1}-\\sin ^{2} \\alpha_{5}=2 \\cos \\left(\\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{5}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\alpha_{1}-108^{\\circ}\\right) \\sin \\left(\\alpha_{5}-108^{\\circ}\\right)>0$. It means that changing the angles $\\alpha_{1}$ by $108^{\\circ}$ and $\\alpha_{5}$ by $\\alpha_{1}+\\alpha_{5}-108^{\\circ}$ increases the sum of squares of the sines.

Thus, $O I \\parallel H N$ with $O I: H N=1: 2$. Therefore, we can detect parallel lines with ratio $2: 1$ in the figure. The only possible pairs are $P_{2} P_{4} \\parallel P_{7} P_{5}$. Therefore, there are two possibilities: $\\left(P_{2}, P_{7}\\right)$ and $\\left(P_{4}, P_{5}\\right)$ must be $(O, H)$ and $(I, N)$ in some order. Intuitively, $H$ should be further out, so it's not unreasonable to guess that $P_{2}=O, P_{7}=H, P_{4}=I$, and $P_{5}=N$. Alternatively, perform the algorithm below with the other case to see if it fails.

Using all information in the above paragraph, we can eyeball a rectangular hyperbola passing through $H, G, N, I$ and is tangent to $O I$. It's then not hard to see that $P_{6}=G$.

Moreover, they lie on this hyperbola in this order because the isogonal conjugates (in order) are $O$, centroid, nine-point center, and $H$, which lies on $O H$ in this order.

{"id": "291", "category": null, "question": "Solution 1\nLet a $n$ -dino denote an animal with $n$ or more cells.\nWe show by induction that an $n$ -dino with $4n-2$ or more animal cells is not primitive. (Note: if it had more, we could just take off enough until it had $4n-2$ , which would have a partition, and then add the cells back on.)\nBase Case: If $n=1$ , we have two cells, which are clearly not primitive.\nInductive Step: Assume any $4n-2$ cell animal can be partitioned into two or more $n$ -dinos.\nFor a given $(4n+2)$ -dino, take off any four cells (call them $w,\\ x,\\ y,\\ z$ ) to get an animal with $4n-2$ cells.\nThis can be partitioned into two or more $n$ -dinos, let's call them $A$ and $B$ . This means that $A$ and $B$ are connected.\nIf both $A$ and $B$ are $(n+1)$ -dinos or if $w,\\ x,\\ y,\\ z$ don't all attach to one of them, then we're done.\nSo assume $A$ has $n$ cells and thus $B$ has at least $3n-2$ cells, and that $w,\\ x,\\ y,\\ z$ are added to $B$ . So $B$ has $3n+2$ cells total.\nLet $C$ denote the cell of $B$ attached to $A$ . There are $3n+1$ cells on $B$ besides $C$ . Thus, of the three (or less) sides of $C$ not attached to $A$ , one of them must have $n+1$ cells by the pigeonhole principle . It then follows that we can add $A$ , $C$ , and the other two sides together to get an $(n+1)$ dino, and the side of $C$ that has $n+1$ cells is also an $n+1$ -dino, so we can partition the animal with $4n+2$ cells into two $(n+1)$ -dinos and we're done.\nThus, our answer is $4(2007) - 3 = 8025$ cells.\n        Example of a solution  Attempting to partition solution into dinosaurs \nSolution 2\nFor simplicity, let $k=2007$ and let $n$ be the number of squares . Let the centers of the squares be vertices , and connect any centers of adjacent squares with edges. Suppose we have some loops . Just remove an edge in the loop. We are still connected since you can go around the other way in the loop. Now we have no loops. Each vertex can have at most 4 edges coming out of it. For each point, assign it the quadruple : $(a,b,c,d)$ where $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , $d$ are the numbers of vertices on each branch, WLOG  $a\\ge b\\ge c\\ge d$ . Note $a+b+c+d=n-1$ .\nClaim: If $n=4k-2$ , then we must be able to divide the animal into two dinosaurs. \nChose a vertex, $v$ , for which $a$ is minimal (i.e. out of all maximal elements in a quadruple, choose the one with the least maximal element).  We have that $4a \\ge a+b+c+d=4k-3$ , so $a\\ge k$ . Hence we can just cut off that branch, that forms a dinosaur.\nBut suppose the remaining vertices do not make a dinosaur. Then we have $b+c+d+1\\le k-1 \\iff n-a\\le k-1\\iff a\\ge 3k-1$ . Now move to the first point on the branch at $a$ . We have a new quadruple $p,\\ q,\\ r,\\ b+c+d+1$ ) where $p+q+r=a-1\\ge 3k-2$ .\nNow consider the maximal element of that quadruple. We already have $b+c+d+1\\le k-1$ . WLOG $p\\ge q\\ge r\\ge 0$ , then $3p\\ge p+q+r=a-1\\ge 3k-2\\implies p\\ge k$ so $p>k-1=b+c+d+1$ , so $p$ is the maximal element of that quadruple.\nAlso $a-1=p+q+r\\ge p+0+0$ , so $p<a$ . But that is a contradiction to the minimality of $a$ . Therefore, we must have that $b+c+d+1\\ge k$ , so we have a partition of two dinosaurs.\nMaximum: $n=4k-3$ .\nConsider a cross with each branch having $k-1$ verticies. Clearly if we take partition $k$ vertices, we remove the center, and we are not connected.\nSo $k=2007$ : $4\\cdot 2007-3=8025$ .\n Solution 3 (Generalization)\nTurn the dinosaur into a graph (cells are vertices , adjacent cells connected by an edge) and prove this result about graphs. A connected graph with $V$ vertices, where each vertex has degree less than or equal to $D$ , can be partitioned into connected components of sizes at least $\\frac{V-1}{D}$ . So then in this special case, we have $D = 4$ , and so $V = 2006 \\times 4+1$ (a possible configuration of this size that works consists of a center and 4 lines of cells each of size 2006 connected to the center). We next throw out all the geometry of this situation, so that we have a completely unconstrained graph. If we prove the above-mentioned result, we can put the geometry back in later by taking the connected components that our partition gives us, then filling back all edges that have to be there due to adjacent cells. This won't change any of the problem constraints, so we can legitimately do this.\nGoing, now, to the case of arbitrary graphs, we WOP on the number of edges. If we can remove any edge and still have a connected graph, then we have found a smaller graph that does not obey our theorem, a contradiction due to the minimality imposed by WOP. Therefore, the only case we have to worry about is when the graph is a tree. If it's a tree, we can root the tree and consider the size of subtrees. Pick the root such that the size of the largest subtree is minimized. This minimum must be at least $\\frac{V-1}{D}$ , otherwise the sum of the size of the subtrees is smaller than the size of the graph, which is a contradiction. Also, it must be at most $\\frac{V}{2}$ , or else pick the subtree of size greater than $\\frac{V}{2}$ and you have decreased the size of the largest subtree if you root from that vertex instead, so you have some subtree with size between $\\frac{V-1}{D}$ and $\\frac V2$ . Cut the edge connecting the root to that subtree, and use that as your partition.\nIt is easy to see that these partitions satisfy the contention of our theorem, so we are done.\nSolution 4\nLet $s$ denote the minimum number of cells in a dinosaur; the number this year is $s = 2007$ .\nClaim: The maximum number of cells in a primitive dinosaur is $4(s - 1) + 1$ .\nFirst, a primitive dinosaur can contain up to $4(s - 1) + 1$ cells. To see this, consider a dinosaur in the form of a cross consisting of a central cell and four arms with $s - 1$ cells apiece. No connected figure with at least $s$ cells can be removed without disconnecting the dinosaur.\nThe proof that no dinosaur with at least $4(s - 1) + 2$ cells is primitive relies on the following result.\nLemma. Let $D$ be a dinosaur having at least $4(s - 1) + 2$ cells, and let $R$ (red) and $B$ (black) be two complementary animals in $D$ , i.e. $R\\cap B = \\emptyset$ and $R\\cup B = D$ . Suppose $|R|\\leq s - 1$ . Then $R$ can be augmented to produce animals $\\~{R}\\subset R$ (Error compiling LaTeX. Unknown error_msg) and $\\{B} = D\\backslash\\{R}$ (Error compiling LaTeX.

Unknown error_msg) ,\n(ii) $|\\{R}| = |R| + 1$ (Error compiling LaTeX. Unknown error_msg) ,\n(iii) $|R| < |\\{R}|\\leq s - 1$ (Error compiling LaTeX. Unknown error_msg) .\nProof. If there is a black cell adjacent to $R$ that can be made red without disconnecting $B$ , then (ii) holds. Otherwise, there is a black cell $c$ adjacent to $R$ whose removal disconnects $B$ . Of the squares adjacent to $c$ , at least one is red, and at least one is black, otherwise $B$ would be disconnected. Then there are at most three resulting components $\\mathcal{C}_1, \\mathcal{C}_2, \\mathcal{C}_3$ of $B$ after the removal of $c$ . Without loss of generality, $\\mathcal{C}_3$ is the largest of the remaining components. (Note that $\\mathcal{C}_1$ or $\\mathcal{C}_2$ may be empty.) Now $\\mathcal{C}_3$ has at least $\\lceil (3s - 2)/3\\rceil = s$ cells. Let $\\{B} = \\mathcal{C}_3$ (Error compiling LaTeX. Unknown error_msg) . Then $|\\{R}| = |R| + |\\mathcal{C}_1| + |\\mathcal{C}_2| + 1$ (Error compiling LaTeX. Unknown error_msg) . If $|\\{B}|\\leq 3s - 2$ (Error compiling LaTeX. Unknown error_msg) , then $|\\{R}|\\geq s$ (Error compiling LaTeX. Unknown error_msg) and (i) holds. If $|\\{B}|\\geq 3s - 1$ (Error compiling LaTeX. Unknown error_msg) then either (ii) or (iii) holds, depending on whether $|\\{R}|\\geq s$ (Error compiling LaTeX. Unknown error_msg) or not. $\\blacksquare$ \nStarting with $|R| = 1$ , repeatedly apply the Lemma. Because in alternatives (ii) and (iii) $|R|$ increases but remains less than $s$ , alternative (i) eventually must occur. This shows that no dinosaur with at least $4(s - 1) + 2$ cells is primitive.\nAlternate solutions are always welcome.

Number the intersection points with the circle from 1 to $2 n$ anticlockwise, starting from Tony (Tony has number 1). We will prove that the friends eligible to receive presents are the ones on even-numbered intersection points. First part: at most $n$ friends can receive a present. The solution relies on a well-known result: the $n$ lines determine regions inside the circle; then it is possible to paint the regions with two colors such that no regions with a common (line) boundary have the same color. The proof is an induction on $n$ : the fact immediately holds for $n=0$, and the induction step consists on taking away one line $\\ell$, painting the regions obtained with $n-1$ lines, drawing $\\ell$ again and flipping all colors on exactly one half plane determined by $\\ell$. Now consider the line starting on point 1. Color the regions in red and blue such that neighboring regions have different colors, and such that the two regions that have point 1 as a vertex are red on the right and blue on the left, from Tony's point of view. Finally, assign to each red region the clockwise direction and to each blue region the anticlockwise direction. Because of the coloring, every boundary will have two directions assigned, but the directions are the same since every boundary divides regions of different colors. Then the present will follow the directions assigned to the regions: it certainly does for both regions in the beginning, and when the present reaches an intersection it will keep bordering one of the two regions it was dividing. To finish this part of the problem, consider the regions that share a boundary with the circle. The directions alternate between outcoming and incoming, starting from 1 (outcoming), so all even-numbered vertices are directed as incoming and are the only ones able to receive presents. Second part: all even-numbered vertices can receive a present. First notice that, since every two chords intersect, every chord separates the endpoints of each of the other $n-1$ chords. Therefore, there are $n-1$ vertices on each side of every chord, and each chord connects vertices $k$ and $k+n, 1 \\leq k \\leq n$. We prove a stronger result by induction in $n$ : let $k$ be an integer, $1 \\leq k \\leq n$. Direct each chord from $i$ to $i+n$ if $1 \\leq i \\leq k$ and from $i+n$ to $i$ otherwise; in other words, the sinks are $k+1, k+2, \\ldots, k+n$. Now suppose that each chord sends a present, starting from the vertex opposite to each sink, and all presents move with the same rules. Then $k-i$ sends a present to $k+i+1, i=0,1, \\ldots, n-1$ (indices taken modulo $2 n$ ). In particular, for $i=k-1$, Tony, in vertex 1 , send a present to vertex $2 k$. Also, the $n$ paths the presents make do not cross (but they may touch.) More formally, for all $i, 1 \\leq i \\leq n$, if one path takes a present from $k-i$ to $k+i+1$, separating the circle into two regions, all paths taking a present from $k-j$ to $k+j+1, j<i$, are completely contained in one region, and all paths taking a present from $k-j$ to $k+j+1, j>i$, are completely contained in the other region. The result is true for $n=1$. Let $n>1$ and assume the result is true for less chords. Consider the chord that takes $k$ to $k+n$ and remove it. Apply the induction hypothesis to the remaining $n-1$ lines: after relabeling, presents would go from $k-i$ to $k+i+2,1 \\leq i \\leq n-1$ if the chord were not there. Reintroduce the chord that takes $k$ to $k+n$. From the induction hypothesis, the chord intersects the paths of the presents in the following order: the $i$-th path the chord intersects is the the one that takes $k-i$ to $k+i, i=1,2, \\ldots, n-1$. Then the presents cover the following new paths: the present from $k$ will leave its chord and take the path towards $k+1$; then, for $i=1,2, \\ldots, n-1$, the present from $k-i$ will meet the chord from $k$ to $k+n$, move towards the intersection with the path towards $k+i+1$ and go to $k+i+1$, as desired.

This implies the result. Now, we begin the solution. Suppose that a prime $p$ divides both $a \\cdot n!-1$ and $a \\cdot(n+1)!+b$. Then, since $$-b \\equiv a \\cdot(n+1)!\\equiv(n+1) \\cdot(a \\cdot n!) \\equiv(n+1) \\quad(\\bmod p)$$ we get that $p \\mid n+b+1$. Since we must have $n<p$ (or else $p \\mid n$ !), we get that, for large enough $n$, $n=p-b-1$.

This forces all fantastic pairs to be in form $((2 k-1)!, 2 k-1)$. Now, we prove that these pairs all work. Take $n=p-2 k$ for all large primes $p$. Then, we have $$\\begin{aligned} a \\cdot n! & \\equiv(2 k-1)!(p-2 k)! \\\\ & \\equiv(-1)^{2 k} \\equiv 1 \\quad(\\bmod p) \\\\ a \\cdot(n+1)! & \\equiv(n+1) \\cdot(a \\cdot n!) \\\\ & \\equiv(p-2 k+1) \\cdot 1 \\equiv-(2 k-1) \\quad(\\bmod p) \\end{aligned}$$ so $p$ divides the gcd.

Because $a_{n}, c_{n}, g_{n}, i_{n}<e_{n}$, none of $a_{n}, c_{n}, g_{n}, i_{n}$ can be equal to 23 . Thus, 3 of $b_{n}, d_{n}, f_{n}, h_{n}$ must be 23 . WLOG assume $b_{n}=d_{n}=f_{n}=23$.

The number $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ can be achieved, for example the symmetric matrices are obviously t-normal and they form a linear space with dimension $\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. We shall show that this is the maximal possible dimension. Let $M_{n}$ denote the space of $n \\times n$ complex matrices, let $S_{n} \\subset M_{n}$ be the subspace of all symmetric matrices and let $A_{n} \\subset M_{n}$ be the subspace of all anti-symmetric matrices, i.e. matrices $A$ for which $A^{t}=-A$. Let $V \\subset M_{n}$ be a linear subspace consisting of t-normal matrices. We have to show that $\\operatorname{dim}(V) \\leq$ $\\operatorname{dim}\\left(S_{n}\\right)$. Let $\\pi: V \\rightarrow S_{n}$ denote the linear map $\\pi(A)=A+A^{t}$.

In other words, $\\operatorname{Ker}(\\pi)$ and $\\operatorname{Im}(\\pi)$ commute. Indeed, if $A, B \\in V$ and $A=-A^{t}$ then $$(A+B)(A+B)^{t}=(A+B)^{t}(A+B) \\Leftrightarrow$$ $$\\Leftrightarrow A A^{t}+A B^{t}+B A^{t}+B B^{t}=A^{t} A+A^{t} B+B^{t} A+B^{t} B \\Leftrightarrow$$ $$\\Leftrightarrow A B^{t}-B A=-A B+B^{t} A \\Leftrightarrow A\\left(B+B^{t}\\right)=\\left(B+B^{t}\\right) A \\Leftrightarrow$$ $$\\Leftrightarrow A \\pi(B)=\\pi(B) A$$ Our bound on the dimension on $V$ follows from the following lemma: Lemma. Let $X \\subseteq S_{n}$ and $Y \\subseteq A_{n}$ be linear subspaces such that every element of $X$ commutes with every element of $Y$. Then $$\\operatorname{dim}(X)+\\operatorname{dim}(Y) \\leq \\operatorname{dim}\\left(S_{n}\\right)$$ Proof. Without loss of generality we may assume $X=Z_{S_{n}}(Y):=\\left\\{x \\in S_{n}: x y=y x \\quad \\forall y \\in Y\\right\\}$. Define the bilinear map $B: S_{n} \\times A_{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}$ by $B(x, y)=\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{x}, \\mathrm{y}])$ where $[x, y]=x y-y x$ and $d=\\operatorname{diag}(1, \\ldots, n)$ is the matrix with diagonal elements $1, \\ldots, n$ and zeros off the diagonal. Clearly $B(X, Y)=\\{0\\}$. Furthermore, if $y \\in Y$ satisfies that $B(x, y)=0$ for all $x \\in S_{n}$ then $\\left.\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathrm{d}[\\mathrm{x}, \\mathrm{y}])=-\\operatorname{tr}([\\mathrm{d}, \\mathrm{x}], \\mathrm{y}]\\right)=0$ for every $x \\in S_{n}$. We claim that $\\left\\{[d, x]: x \\in S_{n}\\right\\}=A_{n}$. Let $E_{i}^{j}$ denote the matrix with 1 in the entry $(i, j)$ and 0 in all other entries. Then a direct computation shows that $\\left[d, E_{i}^{j}\\right]=(j-i) E_{i}^{j}$ and therefore $\\left[d, E_{i}^{j}+E_{j}^{i}\\right]=$ $(j-i)\\left(E_{i}^{j}-E_{j}^{i}\\right)$ and the collection $\\left\\{(j-i)\\left(E_{i}^{j}-E_{j}^{i}\\right)\\right\\}_{1 \\leq i<j \\leq n} \\operatorname{span} A_{n}$ for $i \\neq j$. It follows that if $B(x, y)=0$ for all $x \\in S_{n}$ then $\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathrm{yz})=0$ for every $z \\in A_{n}$. But then, taking $z=\\bar{y}$, where $\\bar{y}$ is the entry-wise complex conjugate of $y$, we get $0=\\operatorname{tr}(\\mathrm{y} \\overline{\\mathrm{y}})=-\\operatorname{tr}\\left(\\mathrm{y} \\overline{\\mathrm{y}}^{\\mathrm{t}}\\right)$ which is the sum of squares of all the entries of $y$. This means that $y=0$. It follows that if $y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{k} \\in Y$ are linearly independent then the equations $$B\\left(x, y_{1}\\right)=0, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad B\\left(x, y_{k}\\right)=0$$ are linearly independent as linear equations in $x$, otherwise there are $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}$ such that $B\\left(x, a_{1} y_{1}+\\ldots+\\right.$ $\\left.a_{k} y_{k}\\right)=0$ for every $x \\in S_{n}$, a contradiction to the observation above. Since the solution of $k$ linearly independent linear equations is of codimension $k$, $$\\begin{gathered}\\operatorname{dim}\\left(\\left\\{x \\in S_{n}:\\left[x, y_{i}\\right]=0, \\text { for } i=1, \\ldots, k\\right\\}\\right) \\leq \\\\ \\leq \\operatorname{dim}\\left(x \\in S_{n}: B\\left(x, y_{i}\\right)=0 \\text { for } i=1, \\ldots, k\\right)=\\operatorname{dim}\\left(S_{n}\\right)-k\\end{gathered}$$ The lemma follows by taking $y_{1}, \\ldots, y_{k}$ to be a basis of $Y$.

{"id": "827", "category": null, "question": "Solution 1. Let $P U, P V$ tangent from $P$ to the incircle. We will invoke the dual of the Desargues Involution Theorem, which states the following: Given a point $P$ in the plane and four lines $\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}$, consider the set of conics tangent to all four lines. Then we define a function on the pencil of lines through $P$ by mapping one tangent from $P$ to each conic to the other. This map is well defined and is a projective involution, and in particular maps $P A \\rightarrow P D, P B \\rightarrow P E, P C \\rightarrow P F$, where $A B C D E F$ is the complete quadrilateral given by the pairwise intersections of $\\ell_{1}, \\ell_{2}, \\ell_{3}, \\ell_{4}$. An overview of the projective background behind the (Dual) Desargues Involution Theorem can be found here: https://www.scribd.com/document/384321704/Desargues-Involution-Theorem, and a proof can be found at https://www2.washjeff.edu/users/mwoltermann/Dorrie/63.pdf. Now, we apply this to the point $P$ and the lines $A B, A C, B C, Y Z$, to get that the pairs $$(P U, P V),(P Y, P B),(P Z, P C)$$ are swapped by some involution. But we know that the involution on lines through $P$ which rotates by $90^{\\circ}$ swaps the latter two pairs, thus it must also swap the first one and $\\angle U P V=90$. It follows by equal tangents that $I U P V$ is a square, thus $I P=r \\sqrt{2}$ where $r$ is the inradius of $A B C$. Since $r=\\frac{2 K}{a+b+c}=\\frac{21 \\sqrt{15} / 2}{21}=\\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{2}$, we have $I P=\\frac{\\sqrt{30}}{2}$. Solution 2. Let $H$ be the orthocenter of $A B C$. Lemma. $H I^{2}=2 r^{2}-4 R^{2} \\cos (A) \\cos (B) \\cos (C)$, where $r$ is the inradius and $R$ is the circumradius. Proof. This follows from barycentric coordinates or the general result that for a point $X$ in the plane, $$a X A^{2}+b X B^{2}+c X C^{2}=(a+b+c) X I^{2}+a A I^{2}+b B I^{2}+c C I^{2}$$ which itself is a fact about vectors that follows from barycentric coordinates. This can also be computed directly using trigonometry. Let $E=B H \\cap A C, F=C H \\cap A B$, then note that $B, P, E, Y$ are concyclic on the circle of diameter $B Y$, and $C, P, F, Z$ are concyclic on the circle of diameter $C Z$. Let $Q$ be the second intersection of these circles. Since $B C Y Z$ is a tangential quadrilateral, the midpoints of $B Y$ and $C Z$ are collinear with $I$ (this is known as Newton's theorem), which implies that $I P=I Q$ by symmetry. Note that as $B H \\cdot H E=C H \\cdot H F, H$ lies on the radical axis of the two circles, which is $P Q$. Thus, if $I P=I Q=x$, $B H \\cdot H E$ is the power of $H$ with respect to the circle centered at $I$ with radius $x$, which implies $B H \\cdot H E=x^{2}-H I^{2}$. As with the first solution, we claim that $x=r \\sqrt{2}$, which by the lemma is equivalent to $B H \\cdot H E=$ $4 R^{2} \\cos (A) \\cos (B) \\cos (C)$. Then note that $$B H \\cdot H E=B H \\cdot C H \\cos (A)=(2 R \\cos (B))(2 R \\cos (C)) \\cos (A)$$ so our claim holds and we finish as with the first solution. Note. Under the assumption that the problem is well-posed (the answer does not depend on the choice of $Y, Z$, or $P$ ), then here is an alternative method to obtain $I P=r \\sqrt{2}$ by making convenient choices. Let $U$ be the point where $Y Z$ is tangent to the incircle, and choose $U$ so that $I U \\| B C$ (and therefore $Y Z \\perp B C)$. Note that $Y Z \\cap B C$ is a valid choice for $P$, so assume that $P$ is the foot from $U$ to $B C$. If $D$ is the point where $B C$ is tangent to the incircle, then $I U P D$ is a square so $I P=r \\sqrt{2}$.

This leads us to count the number of collections on a set of size at most 3 satisfying the desired property with the additional property that the entire set must be in the collection. Let $C_{n}$ denote that number of such collections on a set of size $n$. Our answer will then be $1+\\binom{3}{0} C_{0}+\\binom{3}{1} C_{1}+\\binom{3}{2} C_{2}+\\binom{3}{3} C_{3}$, with the additional 1 coming from the empty collection. Now for such a collection $T$ on a set of $n$ elements, consider the set $I=\\bigcap_{U \\in T} U$. Suppose this set has size $k$. Then removing all these elements from consideration gives us another such collection on a set of size $n-k$, but now containing the empty set. We can see that for each particular choice of $I$, this gives a bijection to the collections on the set $S$ to the collections on the set $S-I$. This leads us to consider the further restricted collections that must contain both the entire set and the empty set. It turns out that such restricted collections are a well-studied class of objects called topological spaces. Let $T_{n}$ be the number of topological spaces on $n$ elements. Our argument before shows that $C_{n}=$ $\\sum_{k=0}^{n}\\binom{n}{k} T_{k}$. It is relatively straightforward to see that $T_{0}=1, T_{1}=1$, and $T_{2}=4$. For a set of size 3 , there are the following spaces. The number of symmetric versions is shown in parentheses. - $\\emptyset,\\{a, b, c\\}(1)$ - $\\emptyset,\\{a, b\\},\\{a, b, c\\}(3)$ - $\\emptyset,\\{a\\},\\{a, b, c\\}(3)$ - $\\emptyset,\\{a\\},\\{a, b\\},\\{a, b, c\\}$ (6) - $\\emptyset,\\{a\\},\\{b, c\\},\\{a, b, c\\}$ - $\\emptyset,\\{a\\},\\{a, b\\},\\{a, c\\},\\{a, b, c\\}(3)$ - $\\emptyset,\\{a\\},\\{b\\},\\{a, b\\} .\\{a, b, c\\}(3)$ - $\\emptyset,\\{a\\},\\{b\\},\\{a, b\\},\\{a, c\\},\\{a, b, c\\}(6)$ - $\\emptyset,\\{a\\},\\{b\\},\\{c\\},\\{a, b\\},\\{a, c\\},\\{b, c\\},\\{a, b, c\\}$ which gives $T_{3}=29$.

Without loss of generality, assume that the sequence $a_{1}<a_{2}<\\cdots<a_{n}$ has the maximum product. Suppose $a_{j+1}>a_{j}+2$. Then, increasing $a_{j}$ by 1 and decreasing $a_{j+1}$ by 1 will increase the product $M$, contradicting the assumption that the sequence has the optimal product.

Then, we can increase $a_{j}$ by 1 and decrease $a_{i+1}$ by 1 to increase the total product. Thus, there is at most one gap, and the sequence $a_{i}$ is of one of the forms described before.

If the next element is 5, we can replace it with a 2 and a 3 to increase the product, and if the next element is 6, we can replace it with a 1,2, and 3 without making the product any smaller.

We show that $x^{s}-1 \\mid$ $P(x)$ for $s=1,2, \\ldots, M$, or equivalently that $P(\\omega)=0$ for all primitive $s$ th roots of unity $1 \\leq s \\leq M)$.

Additionally, this polynomial is unique: assume that there exist two polynomials $p, q$ of degree \\leq 5 such that they map \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\} to the same permutation. Then $p-q$ is a nonzero polynomial of degree \\leq 5 with 6 distinct roots, a contradiction. Thus an upper bound for the answer is $6!=720$ polynomials. However, not every polynomial obtained by Lagrange interpolation is of degree 5 (for example, $p(x)=$ $x)$. We can count the number of invalid polynomials using finite differences. A polynomial has degree less than 5 if and only if the sequence of 5th finite differences is 0. The 5th finite difference of $p(1), p(2), p(3), p(4), p(5), p(6)$ is $p(1)-5 p(2)+10 p(3)-10 p(4)+5 p(5)-p(6)$; thus we want to solve $p(1)-5 p(2)+10 p(3)-10 p(4)+5 p(5)-p(6)=0$ with \\{p(1), p(2), p(3), p(4), p(5), p(6)\\}=\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}.

Let $C\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right)$ denote the convex hull of $S^{\\prime}$. We claim that there exist the problem conditions are satisfied (there exist positive coefficients for the terms so that the polynomial is bounded below) if and only if the vertices of $C\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right)$ all have both coordinates even. For one direction, suppose that $C\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right)$ has a vertex $v=\\left(i^{\\prime}, j^{\\prime}\\right)$ with at least one odd coordinate; WLOG, suppose it is $i^{\\prime}$. Since $v$ is a vertex, it maximizes some objective function $a i+b j$ over $C\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right)$ uniquely, and thus also over $S^{\\prime}$. Since $(0,0) \\in S^{\\prime}$, we must have $a i^{\\prime}+b j^{\\prime}>0$. Now consider plugging in $(x, y)=\\left(-t^{a}, t^{b}\\right)(t>0)$ into $f$. This gives the value $$f\\left(-t^{a}, t^{b}\\right)=\\sum_{(i, j) \\in S}(-1)^{i} c_{i, j} t^{a i+b j}$$ But no matter what positive $c_{i, j}$ we choose, this expression is not bounded below as $t$ grows infinitely large, as there is a $-c_{i^{\\prime}, j^{\\prime}} t^{a i^{\\prime}+b j^{\\prime}}$ term, with $a i^{\\prime}+b j^{\\prime}>0$, and all other terms have smaller powers of $t$.

If all points in $S^{\\prime}$ are vertices of $C\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right)$, then the polynomial is a sum of squares, so it is bounded below. Otherwise, we assume that some points in $S^{\\prime}$ are not vertices of $C\\left(S^{\\prime}\\right)$. It suffices to consider the case where there is exactly one such point.

Now assume that not all the \\(a_{i}\\) are zero the idea is that we are going to subtract 1 from a consecutive subset of the \\(a_{i}\\) so that the value of \\(M^{\\prime}\\) goes down by 1. There are two cases. First of all, if \\(a_{i}=0\\) for some \\(i\\), then we can choose such an \\(i\\) so that \\(a_{i+1}>0\\). Then, let \\(j\\) be the minimal positive integer so that \\(a_{i+j}=0\\). Then subtract 1 from \\(a_{i+1}, \\ldots, a_{i+j-1}\\). It is clear that \\(d\\) decreases by 1. If \\(a_{i+j}=a_{i+j+1}=\\cdots=a_{i}=0\\), then \\(M\\) also goes down by 1. If not, then \\(M<d\\), so \\(M^{\\prime}\\) goes down by 1 anyway. The second case is when \\(a_{i}>0\\) for all \\(i\\). If all the \\(a_{i}\\) are the same then we are done by subtracting 1 from everything. If not, we can find \\(i, j\\) with \\(j>i+1\\) so that \\(a_{i}=M, a_{j}=M\\), and \\(a_{i+1}, a_{i+2}, \\ldots, a_{j-1}<M\\). Then subtract 1 from the complement of \\(a_{j}, a_{j+1}, \\ldots, a_{i-1}\\). Then \\(M\\) goes down by 1 and \\(d\\) goes down by 1. Non-inductive construction. We will prove that if \\(M \\leq d\\), then we may choose \\(m=d\\). If \\(M>d\\), then since \\(d \\geq M-\\min \\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)\\) we can subtract \\(M-d\\) from every \\(a_{i}\\), draw \\(M-d\\) circles containing every point, and apply the below construction. Let \\(a_{i}^{\\prime}=a_{i}-\\min _{j}\\left(a_{j}\\right), A_{h}=\\left\\{i \\mid a_{i}^{\\prime}<h, a_{i+1}^{\\prime} \\geq h\\right\\}, B_{h}=\\left\\{i \\mid a_{i}^{\\prime} \\geq h, a_{i+1}^{\\prime}<h\\right\\}\\). Also, let \\(s_{h}=\\left|A_{h}\\right|=\\left|B_{h}\\right|\\). Note that \\(d=\\sum_{h} s_{h}\\) and that \\(s_{h}>0 \\Longrightarrow h \\leq \\max \\left(a_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)\\). For \\(h \\leq \\max \\left(a_{i}^{\\prime}\\right)\\) and \\(1 \\leq j \\leq s_{h}\\), define an arrangement of circles \\(C_{h}^{(j)}\\) as follows: let the elements of \\(A_{h}\\) and \\(B_{h}\\) be \\(a_{1}, b_{1}, a_{2}, b_{2}, \\ldots\\) in order. Then for each \\(i \\leq s_{h}\\) add a circle covering the points in the interval \\(\\left(a_{i}, b_{i+j}\\right.\\) ]. One can show that point \\(P_{i}\\) is covered by circles \\(j\\) times if \\(a_{i}^{\\prime} \\geq h\\) and \\(j-1\\) times otherwise. Now, for some choice of \\(j_{h}\\) for all \\(h\\), consider taking \\(\\bigcup_{h} C_{h}^{\\left(j_{h}\\right)}\\). Then, \\(P_{i}\\) is covered by circles \\(\\sum_{h} j_{h}+a_{i}-M\\) times.

By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least one row, say the first row, with at least 4 distinct integers in it; in this case, that is exactly 4 , since that is the maximum number of distinct integers in one row. Then, in the remaining 15 rows there must be at least 46 distinct integers (these 46 will also be distinct from the 4 in the first row). Using Pigeonhole again, there will be another row, say the second row, with 4 distinct integers in it. Call the set of integers in the first and second rows $S$. Because the 4 distinct integers in the second row are distinct from the 4 in the first row, there are 8 distinct values in the first two rows, so $|S|=8$. Now consider the subcolumns containing the cells in rows 3 to 16. In each subcolumn, there are at most 2 values not in $S$, because there are already two distinct values in that column from the cells in the first two rows. So, the maximum number of distinct values in the table is $16 \\cdot 2+8=40$, a contradiction. So a valid labeling must have fewer than 50 distinct integers.

Let \\(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\) be the numbers on the blackboard from left to right, and let $$q=0 \\cdot a_{1}+1 \\cdot a_{2}+\\cdots+(n-1) a_{n}.$$ Since each number \\(a_{i}\\) is at least 1, we always have $$q \\leq(n-1) p-(1+\\cdots+(n-1))=(n-1) p-\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}=(n-1) s+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}.$$ Also, if a move changes \\(a_{i}\\) and \\(a_{j}\\) with \\(i<j\\), then \\(t\\) changes by \\(\\operatorname{gcd}(a_{i}, a_{j}) \\leq a_{i}\\) and \\(q\\) increases by $$(j-1) a_{i}-(i-1)(a_{i}-1) \\geq i a_{i}-(i-1)(a_{i}-1) \\geq a_{i}.$$ Hence \\(q-t\\) never decreases. We may assume without loss of generality that the first move involves the rightmost 1. Then immediately after this move, \\(q=0+1+\\cdots+(n-2)+(n-1) \\cdot 2=\\frac{(n+2)(n-1)}{2}\\) and \\(t=1\\). So after that move, we always have $$t \\leq q+1-\\frac{(n+2)(n-1)}{2} \\leq(n-1) s+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2}-\\frac{(n+2)(n-1)}{2}+1 =(n-1) s-(n-2)<(n-1) s.$$ Hence, \\(\\frac{t}{s}<n-1\\). So \\(\\frac{t}{s}\\) must be a rational number in \\([1, n-1)\\). After a single move, we have \\(\\frac{t}{s}=1\\), so it remains to prove that \\(\\frac{t}{s}\\) can be any rational number in \\((1, n-1)\\). We will now show by induction on \\(n\\) that for any positive integer \\(a\\), it is possible to reach a situation where there are \\(n-1\\) occurrences of 1 on the board and the number \\(a^{n-1}\\), with \\(t\\) and \\(s\\) equal to \\(a^{n-2}(a-1)(n-1)\\) and \\(a^{n-1}-1\\), respectively. For \\(n=2\\), this is clear as there is only one possible move at each step, so after \\(a-1\\) moves \\(s\\) and \\(t\\) will both be equal to \\(a-1\\). Now assume that the claim is true for \\(n-1\\), where \\(n>2\\). Call the algorithm which creates this situation using \\(n-1\\) numbers algorithm \\(A\\). Then to reach the situation for size \\(n\\), we apply algorithm \\(A\\), to create the number \\(a^{n-2}\\). Next, apply algorithm \\(A\\) again and then add the two large numbers, repeat until we get the number \\(a^{n-1}\\). Then algorithm \\(A\\) was applied \\(a\\) times and the two larger numbers were added \\(a-1\\) times. Each time the two larger numbers are added, \\(t\\) increases by \\(a^{n-2}\\) and each time algorithm \\(A\\) is applied, \\(t\\) increases by \\(a^{n-3}(a-1)(n-2)\\). Hence, the final value of \\(t\\) is $$t=(a-1) a^{n-2}+a \\cdot a^{n-3}(a-1)(n-2)=a^{n-2}(a-1)(n-1).$$ This completes the induction. Now we can choose 1 and the large number \\(b\\) times for any positive integer \\(b\\), and this will add \\(b\\) stones to each bucket. At this point we have $$\\frac{t}{s}=\\frac{a^{n-2}(a-1)(n-1)+b}{a^{n-1}-1+b}.$$ So we just need to show that for any rational number \\(\\frac{p}{q} \\in(1, n-1)\\), there exist positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) such that $$\\frac{p}{q}=\\frac{a^{n-2}(a-1)(n-1)+b}{a^{n-1}-1+b}.$$ Rearranging, we see that this happens if and only if $$b=\\frac{q a^{n-2}(a-1)(n-1)-p\\left(a^{n-1}-1\\right)}{p-q}.$$ If we choose \\(a \\equiv 1(\\bmod p-q)\\), then this will be an integer, so we just need to check that the numerator is positive for sufficiently large \\(a\\). $$\\begin{aligned} q a^{n-2}(a-1)(n-1)-p\\left(a^{n-1}-1\\right) & >q a^{n-2}(a-1)(n-1)-p a^{n-1} \\\\ & =a^{n-2}(a(q(n-1)-p)-(n-1)) \\end{aligned}$$ which is positive for sufficiently large \\(a\\) since \\(q(n-1)-p>0\\). Alternative solution for the upper bound. Rather than starting with \\(n\\) occurrences of 1, we may start with infinitely many 1s, but we are restricted to having at most \\(n-1\\) numbers which are not equal to 1 on the board at any time. It is easy to see that this does not change the problem. Note also that we can ignore the 1 we write on the board each move, so the allowed move is to rub off two numbers and write their sum. We define the width and score of a number on the board as follows. Colour that number red, then reverse every move up to that point all the way back to the situation when the numbers are all 1s. Whenever a red number is split, colour the two replacement numbers red. The width of the original number is equal to the maximum number of red integers greater than 1 which appear on the board at the same time. The score of the number is the number of stones which were removed from the second bucket during these splits. Then clearly the width of any number is at most \\(n-1\\). Also, \\(t\\) is equal to the sum of the scores of the final numbers. We claim that if a number \\(p>1\\) has a width of at most \\(w\\), then its score is at most \\((p-1) w\\). We will prove this by strong induction on \\(p\\). If \\(p=1\\), then clearly \\(p\\) has a score of 0, so the claim is true. If \\(p>1\\), then \\(p\\) was formed by adding two smaller numbers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). Clearly \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) both have widths of at most \\(w\\). Moreover, if \\(a\\) has a width of \\(w\\), then at some point in the reversed process there will be \\(w\\) numbers in the set \\(\\{2,3,4, \\ldots\\}\\) that have split from \\(a\\), and hence there can be no such numbers at this point which have split from \\(b\\). Between this point and the final situation, there must always be at least one number in the set \\(\\{2,3,4, \\ldots\\}\\) that split from \\(a\\), so the width of \\(b\\) is at most \\(w-1\\). Therefore, \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) cannot both have widths of \\(w\\), so without loss of generality, \\(a\\) has width at most \\(w\\) and \\(b\\) has width at most \\(w-1\\). Then by the inductive hypothesis, \\(a\\) has score at most \\((a-1) w\\) and \\(b\\) has score at most \\((b-1)(w-1)\\). Hence, the score of \\(p\\) is at most $$\\begin{aligned} (a-1) w+(b-1)(w-1)+\\operatorname{gcd}(a, b) & \\leq (a-1) w+(b-1)(w-1)+b \\\\ & =(p-1) w+1-w \\\\ & \\leq (p-1) w \\end{aligned}$$ This completes the induction. Now, since each number \\(p\\) in the final configuration has width at most \\((n-1)\\), it has score less than \\((n-1)(p-1)\\). Hence the number \\(t\\) of stones in the second bucket is less than the sum over the values of \\((n-1)(p-1)\\), and \\(s\\) is equal to the sum of the the values of \\((p-1)\\).

Furthermore, by letting \\( y=1 \\) and simplifying, we get \\( 2f(x)=f\\left(x^{2}+f(1)\\right)-f\\left(x^{2}\\right)-f(1) \\) from which it follows that \\( f(-x)=f(x) \\) must hold for every \\( x \\). Suppose now that \\( f(a)=f(b) \\) holds for some pair of numbers \\( a, b \\). Then, by letting \\( y=a \\) and \\( y=b \\) in the given equation, comparing the two resulting identities and using the fact that \\( f\\left(a^{2}\\right)=f(f(a))=f(f(b))=f\\left(b^{2}\\right) \\) also holds under the assumption, we get the fact that \\( f(a)=f(b) \\Rightarrow f(ax)=f(bx) \\quad \\text{for any real number } x \\).

In the sequel, we shall try to find a non-trivial solution for the problem. So, let us assume from now on that if \\( a \\neq 0 \\) then \\( f(a) \\neq 0 \\) must hold. We first note that since \\( f(f(x))=f\\left(x^{2}\\right) \\) for all \\( x \\), the right-hand side of the given equation equals \\( f\\left(x^{2}\\right)+f\\left(y^{2}\\right)+2f(xy) \\), which is invariant if we interchange \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).

We also have \\( f\\left(t^{2}\\right)=f\\left(-t^{2}\\right)=f(f(s))=f\\left(s^{2}\\right) \\).

On the other hand, if $i=j=1$, then $(2^{1}+1)(2^{1}+1)=9=2^{3}+1$, so 9 is a good number and can divide a good number. Finally, note that since multiplication by 2 in binary just appends additional 0 s, so if $n$ is a good number, then $2 n$ is also a good number. It therefore follows that any good number less than 2012 must be of the form $c \\cdot 2^{k}$, where $c$ belongs to \\{1,3,5,9,17,257\\} (and moreover, all such numbers are good).

It follows that all eigenvalues of $A$ must occur as roots of $p$ (possibly with different multiplicities). Note that for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$ (this can be seen by considering even/odd cases on $k$ ), $$\\left(1+x^{k-1}\\right)^{k} \\geq 0$$ and we conclude that the only eigenvalue of $A$ is 0 with multiplicity $n$. Thus $A$ is nilpotent, and since $A$ is $n \\times n, A^{n}=0$. It follows $A^{k}=0$, and $A=A^{T}$. Hence $A$ can only be the zero matrix: $A$ is real symmetric and so is orthogonally diagonalizable, and all its eigenvalues are 0. Remark. It's fairly easy to prove that eigenvalues must occur as roots of any annihilating polynomial. If $\\lambda$ is an eigenvalue and $v$ an associated eigenvector, then $f(A) v=f(\\lambda) v$.

{"id": "2457", "category": null, "question": "We claim that there are approximately $\\frac{3^{n-1}}{4} n$-ominoes. First, we define an order on the squares in an $n$-omino, as follows: we order the squares from left to right, and within a column, we order the squares from top to bottom. We construct an $n$-omino by starting with a single square and attaching squares, one by one, as close to order we just defined as possible. After the first square is placed, the next square can be attached to its bottom or right side. If the second square is right of the first, then the third square can be attached to the top, right, or bottom edges of the second. The third square cannot be attached to the first square, because the first column must be completed before the second is begun. If the second square is below the first, the third square can be attached to the bottom or right sides of the second square, or the right side of the first way. In either case, there are 3 choices for the third square. Suppose that $m$ squares have been added, and that $k$ squares are in the right-most column right now. If $k=1$, then the next square can be attached to the top, right, or bottom side of this square. If $k>1$, then the next square can be added to the bottom or right side of the last square in this column. The next square can also be added to the right of the top square in this column, so there are still 3 choices for the next square. Therefore, there are $3^{n-1}$ ways to build up the entire $n$-omino. Almost all $n$-omines have no rotational symmetry, so they can be built in 4 different ways by this method. This correction gives us our estimate of $\\frac{3^{n-1}}{4}$ for the number of $n$-ominoes.

{"id": "2508", "category": null, "question": "I claim the answer is 120. First, note that $120=2^{3} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5$, so the sum of divisors is $(1+2+4+8)(1+3)(1+5)=15 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 6=360$. Thus, we need to split the divisors into groups summing to 120 . But then we can just take $\\{120\\},\\{20,40,60\\},\\{1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,15,24,30\\}$. Thus, 120 works. Now we need to show 120 is the lowest. Let $s(n)$ be the sum of divisors. Since $n$ will be in one of the piles, we need $s(n) \\geq 3 n$. First, we claim that $n$ must have at least 3 distinct prime divisors. Surely, if it had 2 distinct prime divisors, say $p$ and $q$, so that $n=p^{a} q^{b}$, then the sum of divisors is $$\\left(1+p+p^{2}+\\ldots+p^{a}\\right)\\left(1+q+q^{2}+\\ldots+q^{b}\\right)=p^{a} q^{b}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{p}+\\ldots+\\frac{1}{p^{a}}\\right)\\left(1+\\frac{1}{q}+\\ldots+\\frac{1}{q^{b}}\\right)$$ However, the expression $1+\\frac{1}{p}+\\ldots+\\frac{1}{p^{a}}$ is maximized when $p$ is minimized, and further, as $a$ is finite must be at most $\\frac{1}{1-\\frac{1}{p}}=\\frac{p}{p-1}$. Thus, the sum of divisors is less than $$p^{a} q^{b} \\frac{p}{p-1} \\frac{q}{q-1} \\leq n \\cdot 2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{2}=3 n$$ Thus, $n$ can't have 2 distinct prime divisors and must have at least 3 distinct prime divisors. As we already discovered 120 works, we need not worry about 4 distinct prime divisors, as the value of $n$ would be at least $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7=210$. We now work through the numbers with 3 distinct divisors. If 2 is not one of them, then the only number that works is $105=3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$, which has a sum of divisors that is not large enough. Therefore, 2 must be a prime divisor of $n$. Additionally, if 3 is not a divisor, then our options are $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 7$ and $2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11$, which also do not work. Therefore, 3 must also be a prime divisor. Then, if 5 is not a prime divisor, then if $n$ is $2 \\cdot 3 \\cdot p$, it has a sum of divisors of $(1+2)(1+3)(1+p)=n \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{p+1}{p}$, which is only at least $3 n$ if $p$ is exactly 2 , which is not feasible. Additionally, if we use $2^{2}$, then the sum of divisors is $(1+2+4)(1+3)(1+p)=n \\cdot \\frac{7}{4} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{p}{p+1}$, so $\\frac{p+1}{p}>\\frac{9}{7} \\Longrightarrow p<4.5$, which also can't happen. Further, we can't have $3^{2}$ be a divisor of $n$ as $2 \\cdot 3^{2} \\cdot 5$ is the only value less than 120 with this, and that also does not work. Lastly, we just need to check $2^{3} \\cdot 3 \\cdot p$, which has a sum of divisors of $(1+2+4+8)(1+3)(1+p)=n \\cdot \\frac{15}{8} \\cdot \\frac{4}{3} \\cdot \\frac{p+1}{p}=n \\cdot \\frac{5}{2} \\cdot \\frac{p}{p+1}$, so $p=5$ and that works.

If $n$ is odd and divisible by 3, we may divide all students into equal groups $E, F, G, H, I, J$. Then the members of trips may be the following: $(E, F, G),(E, F, H),(G, H, I),(G, H, J),(E, I, J)$, $(F, I, J)$. In the remaining cases let $n=2x+3y$ be, where $x$ and $y$ are natural numbers. Let's form the groups $A, B, C, D$ of $x$ students each, and $E, F, G, H, I, J$ of $y$ students each. Then we apply the previous cases and organize the following trips: $(A, B, E, F, G),(C, D, E, F, H),(A, C, G, H, I),(B, D, G, H, J)$, $(A, D, E, I, J),(B, C, F, I, J)$.", "user_prompt": "", "answer_type": null, "prediction": "6", "gold": "6", "correct": 1, "judgement": "The extracted_final_answer is '6', which exactly matches the [correct_answer] of 6.

Since $2<5$, when $n \\geq 2$, the product $n!=1 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 3 \\cdots \\cdots(n-1) \\cdot n$ includes more multiples of 2 than of 5 among the $n$ integers in its product, so $n!$ includes more factors of 2 than of 5. This in turn means that, if $n!$ ends in exactly $m$ zeroes, then $n!=10^{m} \\cdot q$ where $q$ is not divisible by 5, and so the number of zeroes at the end of $n!$ is exactly equal to the number of prime factors of 5 in the prime factorization of $n!$. We note also that as $n$ increases, the number of zeroes at the end of $n!$ never decreases since the number of factors of 5 either stays the same or increases as $n$ increases. For $n=1$ to $n=4$, the product $n!$ includes 0 multiples of 5, so $n!$ ends in 0 zeroes. For $n=5$ to $n=9$, the product $n!$ includes 1 multiple of 5 (namely 5), so $n!$ ends in 1 zero. For $n=10$ to $n=14$, the product $n!$ includes 2 multiples of 5 (namely 5 and 10), so $n!$ ends in 2 zeroes. For $n=15$ to $n=19$, the product $n!$ includes 3 multiples of 5 (namely 5,10 and 15), so $n!$ ends in 3 zeroes. For $n=20$ to $n=24$, the product $n!$ includes 4 multiples of 5 (namely $5,10,15$, and 20), so $n!$ ends in 4 zeroes. For $n=25$ to $n=29$, the product $n!$ includes 5 multiples of 5 (namely $5,10,15,20$, and 25) and includes 6 factors of 5 (since 25 contributes 2 factors of 5), so $n!$ ends in 6 zeroes.

This means that an item in position $x$ with $1 \\leq x \\leq 33$ is moved by an in-shuffle to position $2 x-1$. We can see why this formula works by first moving the items in positions $1,2,3, \\ldots, 31,32,33$ to the even positions $2,4,6, \\ldots, 62,64,66$ (doubling the original position numbers) and then shifting each backwards one position to $1,3,5, \\ldots, 61,63,65$. Also, the items in the second 33 positions $34,35,36, \\ldots, 64,65,66$ are moved by an in-shuffle to the even positions of the resulting list, namely to the positions $2,4,6, \\ldots, 62,64,66$ respectively. This means that an item in position $x$ with $34 \\leq x \\leq 66$ is moved by an in-shuffle to position $2(x-33)$.

In summary, the item in position $x$ is moved by an in-shuffle to position - $2 x-1$ if $1 \\leq x \\leq 33$ - $2(x-33)$ if $34 \\leq x \\leq 66$ Therefore, the integer 47 is moved successively as follows: List | Position 1 | 47 2 | $2(47-33)=28$ 3 | $2(28)-1=55$ 4 | $2(55-33)=44$ 5 | $2(44-33)=22$ 6 | $2(22)-1=43$ 7 | $2(43-33)=20$ 8 | $2(20)-1=39$ 9 | $2(39-33)=12$ 10 | $2(12)-1=23$ 11 | $2(23)-1=45$ 12 | $2(45-33)=24$ 13 | $2(24)-1=47$ Because the integer 47 moves back to position 47 in list 13, this means that its positions continue in a cycle of length 12: $47,28,55,44,22,43,20,39,12,23,45,24$ This is because the position to which an integer moves is completely determined by its previous position and so the list will cycle once one position repeats. We note that the integer 47 is thus in position 24 in every 12th list starting at the 12th list. Since $12 \\times 83=996$ and $12 \\times 84=1008$, the cycle occurs a total of 83 complete times and so the integer 47 is in the 24th position in 83 lists.

Note also that $35k = 5^1 \\times 7^1 \\times k$. Let $d$ be the greatest common divisor of 205800 and $35k$. We want to find the number of possible values of $k \\leq 2940$ for which $d$ is a perfect square. Since both 5 and 7 are prime divisors of 205800 and $35k$, then 5 and 7 are both prime divisors of $d$. For $d$ to be a perfect square, 5 and 7 must both divide $d$ an even number of times. Since the prime powers of 5 and 7 in the prime factorization of 205800 are $5^2$ and $7^3$, respectively, then for $d$ to be a perfect square, it must be the case that $5^2$ and $7^2$ are factors of $d$. Since $d = 5 \\times 7 \\times k$, then $k = 5 \\times 7 \\times j = 35j$ for some positive integer $j$. Since $k \\leq 2940$, then $35j \\leq 2940$ which gives $j \\leq 84$. We now know that $d$ is the gcd of $2^3 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^2 \\times 7^3$ and $5^2 \\times 7^2 \\times j$. What further information does this give us about $j$? - $j$ cannot be divisible by 3, otherwise $d$ would have a factor of $3^1$ and cannot have a factor of $3^2$ which would mean that $d$ is not a perfect square. - $j$ cannot be divisible by 7, otherwise $d$ has a factor of $7^3$ and no larger power of 7, in which case $d$ would not be a perfect square. - If $j$ is divisible by 2, then the prime factorization of $j$ must include $2^2$. In other words, the prime factorization of $j$ cannot include $2^1$ or $2^3$. - $j$ can be divisible by 5 since even if $j$ is divisible by 5, the power of 5 in $d$ is already limited by the power of 5 in 205800. - $j$ can be divisible by prime numbers other than $2, 3, 5$ or 7 since 205800 is not and so the gcd will not be affected. Finally, we consider two cases: $j$ is divisible by $2^2$ but not by a larger power of 2, and $j$ is not divisible by 2. Case 1: $j$ is divisible by $2^2$ but not by a larger power of 2 Here, $j = 2^2h = 4h$ for some odd positive integer $h$. Since $j \\leq 84$, then $4h \\leq 84$ which means that $h \\leq 21$.

Each of these values of $h$ produces a value of $j$ that satisfies the conditions in the five bullets above. There are thus 6 values of $j$ in this case. Case 2: $j$ is not divisible by 2 Here, $j$ is odd.

{"id": "3000", "category": null, "question": "Throughout this solution, we remove the units (cm) as each length is in these same units. First, we calculate the distance flown by the fly, which we call \\(f\\). Let \\(Z\\) be the point on the base on the prism directly underneath \\(Y\\). Since the hexagonal base has side length 30, then \\(XZ = 60\\). This is because a hexagon is divided into 6 equilateral triangles by its diagonals, and so the length of the diagonal is twice the side length of one of these triangles, which is twice the side length of the hexagon. Also, \\(\\triangle XZY\\) is right-angled at \\(Z\\), since \\(XZ\\) lies in the horizontal base and \\(YZ\\) is vertical. By the Pythagorean Theorem, since \\(XY > 0\\), then \\(XY = \\sqrt{XZ^{2} + YZ^{2}} = \\sqrt{60^{2} + 165^{2}}\\). Therefore, \\(f = XY = \\sqrt{60^{2} + 165^{2}}\\). Next, we calculate the distance crawled by the ant, which we call \\(a\\). Since the ant crawls \\(n + \\frac{1}{2}\\) around the prism and its crawls along all 6 of the vertical faces each time around the prism, then it crawls along a total of \\(6(n + \\frac{1}{2}) = 6n + 3\\) faces. To find \\(a\\), we 'unwrap' the exterior of the prism. Since the ant passes through \\(6n + 3\\) faces, it travels a 'horizontal' distance of \\((6n + 3) \\cdot 30\\). Since the ant moves from the bottom of the prism to the top of the prism, it passes through a vertical distance of 165. Since the ant's path has a constant slope, its path forms the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with base of length \\((6n + 3) \\cdot 30\\) and height of length 165.

Note that $k^{2}=100\\left(c^{2}+c\\right)+10(2 c+3)+6$ and so the units digit of $k^{2}$ is 6. \n For $k$ to be an Anderson number, we need the tens digit of $k^{2}$ to be $c$, in which case the final two digits of $k^{2}$ will be $c 6$. \n Thus, the tens digit of $k^{2}$ is equal to the units digit of $2 c+3$. \n This means that $k=10 c+6$ is an Anderson number exactly when the units digit of $2 c+3$ is equal to the digit $c$. \n When we check the nine possible values for $c$, we find that the only possibility is that $c=7$. \n This means that $k=76$ is the only two-digit even Anderson number. \n Note that $76^{2}=5776$, which ends with the digits 76. \n Next, we look for three-digit even Anderson numbers $k$. \n Using a similar argument to above, we see that $k$ must have digits $b 76$. \n In other words, $k=100 b+76$ for some digit $b$. \n In this case, $k^{2}=(100 b+76)^{2}=10000 b^{2}+15200 b+5776$. \n We note that the tens and units digits of $k^{2}$ are 76, which means that, for $k$ to be an Anderson number, the hundreds digit of $k^{2}$ must be $b$. \n Now $k^{2}=1000\\left(10 b^{2}+15 b+5\\right)+100(2 b+7)+76$. \n Thus, $k$ is an Anderson number exactly when the units digit of $2 b+7$ is equal to the digit $b$. \n Again, checking the nine possible values for $b$ shows us that $b=3$ is the only possibility. \n This means that $k=376$ is the only three-digit even Anderson number. \n Note that $376^{2}=141376$, which ends with the digits 376. \n Since Anderson numbers are less than 10000, then we still need to look for four-digit even Anderson numbers. \n Again, using a similar argument, we see that $k$ must have digits $a 376$. \n In other words, $k=1000 a+376$ for some digit $a$. \n In this case, $k^{2}=(1000 a+376)^{2}=1000000 a^{2}+752000 a+141376$. \n We note that the hundreds, tens and units digits of $k^{2}$ are 376, which means that, for $k$ to be an Anderson number, the thousands digit of $k^{2}$ must be $a$. \n Now $k^{2}=10000\\left(100 a^{2}+75 a+14\\right)+1000(2 a+1)+376$. \n Thus, $k$ is an Anderson number exactly when the units digit of $2 a+1$ is equal to the digit $a$. Again, checking the nine possible values for $a$ shows us that $a=9$ is the only possibility. \n This means that $k=9376$ is the only four-digit even Anderson number. \n Note that $9376^{2}=87909376$, which ends with the digits 9376. \n Thus, $S$, the sum of the even Anderson numbers, equals $6+76+376+9376=9834$. \n The sum of the digits of $S$ is $9+8+3+4=24$.", "user_prompt": "", "answer_type": null, "prediction": "24", "gold": "24", "correct": 1, "judgement": "The extracted_final_answer '24' exactly matches the [correct_answer] provided.

Case 2: 2023 appears 4 times Here, the list would be 2023, 2023, 2023, 2023, $x$ where $x$ is either less than or greater than 2023. Since the mean of the list is 2023, the sum of the numbers in the list is $5 \\times 2023$, which means that $x=5 \\times 2023-4 \\times 2023=2023$, which is a contradiction.

In the first case, the mean of the list is less than 2023, since the sum of the numbers will be less than $5 \\times 2023$. In the third case, the mean of the list is greater than 2023, since the sum of the numbers will be greater than $5 \\times 2023$. So we need to consider the list $a$, 2023, 2023, 2023, $e$ with $a<2023<e$. Since the mean of this list is 2023, then the sum of the five numbers is $5 \\times 2023$, which means that $a+e=2 \\times 2023$. Since $a$ is a positive integer, then $1 \\leq a \\leq 2022$. For each such value of $a$, there is a corresponding value of $e$ equal to $4046-a$, which is indeed greater than 2023. Since there are 2022 choices for $a$, there are 2022 lists in this case. Case 4A: 2023 appears 2 times; $c=d=2023$ (We note that if 2023 appears 2 times, then since $c=2023$ and $a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq d \\leq e$, we either have $c=d=2023$ or $b=c=2023$.)

For this to be the case, the sum of its numbers equals $5 \\times 2023$, which means that $a+b+e=3 \\times 2023=6069$. Every pair of values for $a$ and $b$ with $1 \\leq a<b<2023$ will give such a list by defining $e=6069-a-b$. (We note that since $a<b<2023$ we will indeed have $e>2023$.) If $a=1$, there are 2021 possible values for $b$, namely $2 \\leq b \\leq 2022$. If $a=2$, there are 2020 possible values for $b$, namely $3 \\leq b \\leq 2022$. Each time we increase $a$ by 1, there will be 1 fewer possible value for $b$, until $a=2021$ and $b=2022$ (only one value). Therefore, the number of pairs of values for $a$ and $b$ in this case is $2021+2020+\\cdots+2+1=\\frac{1}{2} \\times 2021 \\times 2022=2021 \\times 1011$. This is also the number of lists in this case. Case 4B: 2023 appears 2 times; $b=c=2023$ Here, the list is $a, 2023,2023, d, e$ with $1 \\leq a<2023<d<e$.

For this to be the case, the sum of its numbers equals $5 \\times 2023$, which means that $a+d+e=3 \\times 2023=6069$. If $d=2024$, then $a+e=4045$. Since $1 \\leq a \\leq 2022$ and $2025 \\leq e$, we could have $e=2025$ and $a=2020$, or $e=2026$ and $a=1019$, and so on. There are 2020 such pairs, since once $a$ reaches 1, there are no more possibilities. If $d=2025$, then $a+e=4044$. Since $1 \\leq a \\leq 2022$ and $2026 \\leq e$, we could have $e=2026$ and $a=2018$, or $e=2027$ and $a=1017$, and so on. There are 2018 such pairs. As $d$ increases successively by 1, the sum $a+e$ decreases by 1 and the minimum value for $e$ increases by 1, which means that the maximum value for $a$ decreases by 2, which means that the number of pairs of values for $a$ and $e$ decreases by 2. This continues until we reach $d=3033$ at which point there are 2 pairs for $a$ and $e$. Therefore, the number of pairs of values for $a$ and $e$ in this case is $2020+2018+2016+\\cdots+4+2$ which is equal to $2 \\times(1+2+\\cdots+1008+1009+1010)$ which is in turn equal to $2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times 1010 \\times 1011$ which equals $1010 \\times 1011$. Combining all of the cases, the total number of lists $a, b, c, d, e$ is $N=1+2022+2021 \\times 1011+1010 \\times 1011=1+1011 \\times(2+2021+1010)=1+1011 \\times 3033$ and so $N=3066364$.

{"id": "3047", "category": null, "question": "When Yann removes 4 of the $n$ integers from his list, there are $n-4$ integers left. Suppose that the sum of the $n-4$ integers left is $T$. The average of these $n-4$ integers is $89.5625=89.5+0.0625=89+\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{16}=89 \\frac{9}{16}=\\frac{1433}{16}$. Since the sum of the $n-4$ integers is $T$, then $\\frac{T}{n-4}=\\frac{1433}{16}$ which means that $16 T=1433(n-4)$. Since 1433 and 16 have no common divisor larger than 1 (the positive divisors of 16 are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, none of which other than 1 is a divisor of 1433), the value of $n-4$ is a multiple of 16. Since $100<p<q<r<s$, the original list includes more than 100 numbers. Since the original list includes consecutive integers starting at 1 and only 4 of more than 100 numbers are removed, it seems likely that the average of the original list and the average of the new list should be relatively similar. Since the average of the new list is 89.5625 which is close to 90, it seems reasonable to say that the average of the original list is close to 90. Since the original list is a list of consecutive positive integers starting at 1, this means that we would guess that the original list has roughly 180 integers in it. In other words, $n$ appears to be near 180. We do know that $n-4$ is a multiple of 16. The closest multiples of 16 to 180 are 160, 176 and 192, which correspond to $n=164, n=180$, and $n=196$. Suppose that $n=180$, which seems like the most likely possibility. We will show at the end of the solution that this is the only possible value of $n$. The equation $\\frac{T}{n-4}=89.5625$ gives $T=176 \\times 89.5625=15763$. The sum of the $n$ integers in the original list is $1+2+3+4+\\cdots+(n-1)+n=\\frac{1}{2} n(n+1)$. When $n=180$, the sum of the integers $1,2,3, \\ldots, 178,179,180$ is $\\frac{1}{2}(180)(181)=16290$. Since the sum of the numbers in the original list is 16290 and the sum once the four numbers are removed is 15763, the sum of the four numbers removed is $16290-15763=527$. In other words, $p+q+r+s=527$. We now want to count the number of ways in which we can choose $p, q, r, s$ with the conditions that $100<p<q<r<s \\leq 180$ and $p+q+r+s=527$ with at least three of $p, q, r, s$ consecutive. The fourth of these integers is at least 101 and at most 180, which means that the sum of the three consecutive integers is at least $527-180=347$ and is at most $527-101=426$. This means that the consecutive integers are at least $115,116,117$ (whose sum is 348) since $114+115+116=345$ which is too small and smaller integers will give sums that are smaller still. If $p, q, r$ equal $115,116,117$, then $s=527-348=179$. The consecutive integers are at most $141,142,143$ (whose sum is 426) since $142+143+144=429$ which is too large and larger integers will give sums that are larger still. If $p, q, r$ equal $141,142,143$, then $s=527-426=101$. When each of the three consecutive integers is increased by 1 and the sum is constant, the fourth integer is decreased by 3 to maintain this constant sum. Using all of this, we obtain the following lists $p, q, r, s$: $115,116,117,179$; $116,117, 118, 176$; ... ; $130,131, 132, 134$ $128,132,133,134$; $125,133,134,135$; ... ; $101,141,142,143$ Note that we cannot use 131, 132, 133, 131, since $p, q, r, s$ must be distinct. There are 26 lists of integers that can be removed (16 in the first set and 10 in the second set). The corresponding values of $s$ are: $179,176,173,170,167,164,161,158,155,152,149,146,143,140,137,134$ $134,135,136,137,138,139,140,141,142,143$ There are 4 values of $s$ that overlap between the two lists, and so there are $26-4=22$ possible values for $s$. Why is $n=180$ the only possible value of $n$? To see this, we use the fact that the average of the list of consecutive integers starting at $a$ and ending at $b$ equals the average of $a$ and $b$, or $\\frac{a+b}{2}$. (This is true because the integers in the list have a constant difference and are thus evenly distributed, which means that the average of the first and last integers will equal the average of all of the integers in the list.) The original list of integers is $1,2, \\ldots, n-1, n$ which has an average of $\\frac{n+1}{2}$. If the four largest integers are removed from the list, the new list is $1,2, \\ldots, n-5, n-4$, which has an average of $\\frac{n-3}{2}$. If the four smallest integers are removed from the list, the new list is $5,6, \\ldots, n-1, n$, which has an average of $\\frac{n+5}{2}$. When any four integers are removed, the sum of the remaining integers is greater than or equal to the sum of $1,2, \\ldots, n-5, n-4$ and less than or equal to the sum of $5,6, \\ldots, n-1, n$. Since the denominator in the average calculation remains the same, the average of any of the lists after four numbers are removed is at least $\\frac{n-3}{2}$ and at most $\\frac{n+5}{2}$. This means that the actual average (which is 89.5625) is greater than or equal to $\\frac{n-3}{2}$ and less than or equal to $\\frac{n+5}{2}$. Since $89.5625 \\geq \\frac{n-3}{2}$, then $n-3 \\leq 179.125$ and so $n \\leq 182.125$. Since $89.5625 \\leq \\frac{n+5}{2}$, then $n+5 \\geq 179.125$ and so $n \\geq 174.125$. Since $n$ is an integer, then $175 \\leq n \\leq 182$ and so $171 \\leq n-4 \\leq 178$.

{"id": "3057", "category": null, "question": "Consider a $1 \\times 1 \\times 1$ cube. We associate a triple $(x, y, z)$ of real numbers with $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 1$ and $0 \\leq z \\leq 1$ with a point inside this cube by letting $x$ be the perpendicular distance of a point from the left face, $y$ the perpendicular distance of a point from the front face, and $z$ the perpendicular distance from the bottom face. We call this point $(x, y, z)$. Choosing $x, y$ and $z$ randomly and independently between 0 and 1 is equivalent to randomly and uniformly choosing a point $(x, y, z)$ on or inside the cube. The conditions that $-\\frac{1}{2}<x-y<\\frac{1}{2}$ and $-\\frac{1}{2}<x-z<\\frac{1}{2}$ restrict the values of $x, y$ and $z$ that can be chosen, which translates into restricting the points inside the cube that satisfy these conditions. Hence, these restrictions determine a region inside this cube. The probability that a point randomly chosen inside this cube satisfies the given conditions will be equal to the volume of the region defined by the conditions divided by the volume of the entire cube. Since the volume of the cube is 1, then the probability will equal the volume of the region defined by those conditions. Consider now the region in the $xy$-plane defined by $-\\frac{1}{2}<x-y<\\frac{1}{2}$. Re-arranging these inequalities, we obtain $x-\\frac{1}{2}<y<x+\\frac{1}{2}$, which means that a point $(x, y)$ that satisfies these conditions lies above the line with equation $y=x-\\frac{1}{2}$ and below the line with equation $y=x+\\frac{1}{2}$. Restricting to $0 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 1$, we obtain a region. Similarly, the conditions $-\\frac{1}{2}<x-z<\\frac{1}{2}$ give $x-\\frac{1}{2}<z<x+\\frac{1}{2}$, which has the same shape in the $xz$-plane. Therefore, we can slice the cube from front to back to look like this shape. Now, we need to determine the volume of the remaining region. To determine the volume of the region, we split the $1 \\times 1 \\times 1$ cube into eight cubes each measuring $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2}$. When this cube is sliced by the restrictions corresponding to $x-\\frac{1}{2}<y<x+\\frac{1}{2}$, the back left and front right cubes on the top and bottom layers are sliced in half. When this cube is sliced by the restrictions corresponding to $x-\\frac{1}{2}<z<x+\\frac{1}{2}$, the top left and bottom right cubes in the front and back are sliced in half. The eight little cubes are sliced as follows: Bottom front left and top back right: these cubes are not sliced in either direction and so contribute $(\\frac{1}{2})^{3}=\\frac{1}{8}$ to the volume of the solid. Bottom back left, bottom back right, top front left, top front right: these cubes are sliced in half in one direction and are not sliced in the other direction, and so contribute $\\frac{1}{2}$ of their volume (or $\\frac{1}{16}$ each) to the solid. Top back left and bottom front right: Each of these cubes is sliced in half in two directions. The first slice cuts the cube into a triangular prism, whose volume is half of the volume of the little cube, or $\\frac{1}{16}$. The second slice creates a square-based pyramid out of this prism. The pyramid has base with edge length $\\frac{1}{2}$ and height $\\frac{1}{2}$, and so has volume $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2}=\\frac{1}{24}$.

By the Pythagorean Theorem, \\( QT^2 = PT^2 + PQ^2 = n^2 + (2r)^2 = n^2 + 4r^2 \\). So we need to determine the values of \\( n \\) and \\( r \\). We will use the information about \\( QU \\) and \\( UT \\) to determine these values. Join \\( U \\) to \\( O \\). Since \\( U \\) is halfway between \\( R \\) and \\( S \\), then the arcs \\( RU \\) and \\( US \\) are each one-quarter of the circle that bounds the top face of the cylinder.

Since 29 and 37 are prime numbers, the integer 1073 has only four positive divisors: 1, 29, 37, 1073.

It appears that, starting with \\(5^{2}\\), the rightmost two digits of powers of 5 are always 25. To see this, we want to understand why if the rightmost two digits of a power of 5 are 25, then the rightmost two digits of the next power of 5 are also 25. The rightmost two digits of a power of 5 are completely determined by the rightmost two digits of the previous power, since in the process of multiplication, any digits before the rightmost two digits do not affect the rightmost two digits of the product. This means that the rightmost two digits of every power of 5 starting with \\(5^{2}\\) are 25, which means that the rightmost two digits of \\(5^{129}\\) are 25. The first few powers of 4 are \\(4^{1} = 4\\), \\(4^{2} = 16\\), \\(4^{3} = 64\\), \\(4^{4} = 256\\), \\(4^{5} = 1024\\), \\(4^{6} = 4096\\), \\(4^{7} = 16384\\), \\(4^{8} = 65536\\), \\(4^{9} = 262144\\), \\(4^{10} = 1048576\\), \\(4^{11} = 4194304\\), \\(4^{12} = 16777216\\).

From the given conditions, $W > X, W > V, Y > X$, and $Y > Z$. The digits 1 and 3 cannot be placed as $W$ or $Y$, since $W$ and $Y$ are larger than both of their neighbouring digits, while 1 is smaller than all of the other digits and 3 is only larger than one of the other possible digits. The digit 9 cannot be placed as $V, X$ or $Z$ since it is the largest possible digit and so cannot be smaller than $W$ or $Y$. Thus, 9 is placed as $W$ or as $Y$. Therefore, the digits $W$ and $Y$ are 9 and either 5 or 7. Suppose that $W = 9$ and $Y = 5$. The number is thus $V 9 X 5 Z$.

{"id": "3085", "category": null, "question": "For each positive integer $n, S(n)$ is defined to be the smallest positive integer divisible by each of $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$. In other words, $S(n)$ is the least common multiple (lcm) of $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$. To calculate the lcm of a set of numbers, we determine the prime factorization of each number in the set, determine the list of prime numbers that occur in these prime factorizations, determine the highest power of each prime number from this list that occurs in the prime factorizations, and multiply these highest powers together. For example, to calculate $S(8)$, we determine the lcm of $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$. The prime factorizations of the numbers $2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8$ are $2, 3, 2^{2}, 5, 2 \\cdot 3, 7, 2^{3}$. The primes used in this list are $2, 3, 5, 7$, with highest powers $2^{3}, 3^{1}, 5^{1}, 7^{1}$. Therefore, $S(8) = 2^{3} \\cdot 3^{1} \\cdot 5^{1} \\cdot 7^{1}$. Since $S(n)$ is the lcm of $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$ and $S(n+4)$ is the lcm of $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n, n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4$, then $S(n) \\neq S(n+4)$ if either (i) there are prime factors that occur in $n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4$ that don't occur in $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$ or (ii) there is a higher power of a prime that occurs in the factorizations of one of $n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4$ that doesn't occur in any of $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$. For (i) to occur, consider a prime number $p$ that is a divisor of one of $n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4$ and none of $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$. This means that the smallest positive integer that has $p$ as a divisor is one of the integers $n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4$, which in fact means that this integer equals $p$. (The smallest multiple of a prime $p$ is $1 \\cdot p$, or $p$ itself.) Thus, for (i) to occur, one of $n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4$ is a prime number. For (ii) to occur, consider a prime power $p^{k}$ (with $k > 1$) that is a divisor of one of $n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4$ and none of $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, n$. Using a similar argument to condition (i), one of $n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4$ must equal that prime power $p^{k}$. Therefore, $S(n) \\neq S(n+4)$ whenever one of $n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4$ is a prime number or a prime power. In other words, $S(n) = S(n+4)$ whenever none of $n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4$ is a prime number or a prime power. Therefore, we want to determine the positive integers $n$ with $1 \\leq n \\leq 100$ for which none of $n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4$ is a prime number or a prime power.

(We go up to 104 since $n$ can be as large as 100 so $n+4$ can be as large as 104.) The prime powers (with exponent at least 2) less than or equal to 100 are $4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 9, 27, 81, 25, 49$. There are 5 powers of 2, 3 powers of 3, 1 power of 5, and 1 power of 7 in this list. No primes larger than 7 have a power less than 100. Therefore, we want to count the positive integers $n$ with $1 \\leq n \\leq 100$ for which none of $n+1, n+2, n+3, n+4$ appear in the list $2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 53, 59, 61, 64, 67, 71, 73, 79, 81, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103$.

{"id": "3534", "category": null, "question": "No, there do not. \\textbf{First solution:} Suppose the contrary. By setting $y=-1,0,1$ in succession, we see that the polynomials $1-x+x^2, 1, 1+x+x^2$ are linear combinations of $a(x)$ and $b(x)$. But these three polynomials are linearly independent, so cannot all be written as linear combinations of two other polynomials, contradiction. Alternate formulation: the given equation expresses a diagonal matrix with $1,1,1$ and zeroes on the diagonal, which has rank 3, as the sum of two matrices of rank 1. But the rank of a sum of matrices is at most the sum of the ranks of the individual matrices. \\textbf{Second solution:} It is equivalent (by relabeling and rescaling) to show that $1 + xy + x^2y^2$ cannot be written as $a(x) d(y) - b(x) c(y)$. Write $a(x) = \\sum a_i x^i$, $b(x) = \\sum b_i x^i$, $c(y) = \\sum c_j y^j$, $d(y) = \\sum d_j y^j$. We now start comparing coefficients of $1 + xy + x^2 y^2$. By comparing coefficients of $1+xy + x^2y^2 $ and $a(x)d(y) - b(x)c(y)$, we get \\begin{align*} 1 &= a_id_i - b_i c_i \\qquad (i=0,1,2)\\\\ 0 &= a_id_j - b_i c_j \\qquad (i \\neq j). \\end{align*} The first equation says that $a_i$ and $b_i$ cannot both vanish, and $c_i$ and $d_i$ cannot both vanish. The second equation says that $a_i/b_i = c_j/d_j$ when $i \\neq j$, where both sides should be viewed in $\\RR \\cup \\{\\infty\\}$ (and neither is undetermined if $i,j \\in \\{0,1,2\\}$). But then \\[ a_0/b_0 = c_1/d_1 = a_2/b_2 = c_0/d_0 \\] contradicting the equation $a_0d_0 - b_0c_0 = 1$. \\textbf{Third solution:} We work over the complex numbers, in which we have a primitive cube root $\\omega$ of 1. We also use without further comment unique factorization for polynomials in two variables over a field. And we keep the relabeling of the second solution. Suppose the contrary. Since $1+xy+x^2y^2 = (1 - xy/\\omega)(1 - xy/\\omega^2)$, the rational function $a(\\omega/y) d(y) - b(\\omega/y) c(y)$ must vanish identically (that is, coefficient by coefficient). If one of the polynomials, say $a$, vanished identically, then one of $b$ or $c$ would also, and the desired inequality could not hold. So none of them vanish identically, and we can write \\[ \\frac{c(y)}{d(y)} = \\frac{a(\\omega/y)}{b(\\omega/y)}. \\] Likewise, \\[ \\frac{c(y)}{d(y)}= \\frac{a(\\omega^2/y)}{b(\\omega^2/y)}. \\] Put $f(x) = a(x)/b(x)$; then we have $f(\\omega x) = f(x)$ identically. That is, $a(x) b(\\omega x) = b(x) a(\\omega x)$. Since $a$ and $b$ have no common factor (otherwise $1+xy+x^2y^2$ would have a factor divisible only by $x$, which it doesn't since it doesn't vanish identically for any particular $x$), $a(x)$ divides $a(\\omega x)$. Since they have the same degree, they are equal up to scalars. It follows that one of $a(x), xa(x), x^2a(x)$ is a polynomial in $x^3$ alone, and likewise for $b$ (with the same power of $x$). If $xa(x)$ and $xb(x)$, or $x^2 a(x)$ and $x^2 b(x)$, are polynomials in $x^3$, then $a$ and $b$ are divisible by $x$, but we know $a$ and $b$ have no common factor. Hence $a(x)$ and $b(x)$ are polynomials in $x^3$. Likewise, $c(y)$ and $d(y)$ are polynomials in $y^3$. But then $1 + xy + x^2 y^2 = a(x)d(y) - b(x) c(y)$ is a polynomial in $x^3$ and $y^3$, contradiction. \\textbf{Note:} The third solution only works over fields of characteristic not equal to 3, whereas the other two work over arbitrary fields.

We note several algebraic identities, each of which can be checked by expanding and simplifying: $1-x^{5}=(1-x)\\left(1+x+x^{2}+x^{3}+x^{4}\\right)$, $1-x^{3}=(1-x)\\left(1+x+x^{2}\\right)$, $1-x^{4}=\\left(1-x^{2}\\right)\\left(1+x^{2}\\right)=(1-x)(1+x)\\left(1+x^{2}\\right)$, $1+x^{3}=(1+x)\\left(1-x+x^{2}\\right)$, $1-x^{6}=\\left(1-x^{3}\\right)\\left(1+x^{3}\\right)=(1-x)(1+x)\\left(1-x+x^{2}\\right)\\left(1+x+x^{2}\\right)$.

Since $a>d+e+f$ and $e>c$ and $b>c+d$, then the exponents $a-d-e-f$ and $b-c-d$ and $e-c$ are positive integers. Define $A=a-d-e-f, B=b-c-d, C=e-c, D=d, E=f$, and $F=c$. We want the expansion of $f(x)=(1-x)^{A}(1+x)^{B}\\left(1-x^{3}\\right)^{C}\\left(1-x^{4}\\right)^{D}\\left(1-x^{5}\\right)^{E}\\left(1-x^{6}\\right)^{F}$ to have only terms $1-2 x$ when all terms involving $x^{7}$ or larger are removed. We use the facts that $(1+y)^{n}=1+n y+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} y^{2}+\\cdots$ and $(1-y)^{n}=1-n y+\\frac{n(n-1)}{2} y^{2}+\\cdots$ which can be derived by multiplying out directly or by using the Binomial Theorem. Since each factor contains a constant term of 1, then $f(x)$ will have a constant term of 1, regardless of the values of $A, B, C, D, E, F$. Consider the first two factors. Only these factors can affect the coefficients of $x$ and $x^{2}$ in the final product. Any terms involving $x$ and $x^{2}$ in the final product will come from these factors multiplied by the constant 1 from each of the other factors. We consider the product of the first two factors ignoring any terms of degree three or higher: $(1-x)^{A}(1+x)^{B}=\\left(1-A x+\\frac{A(A-1)}{2} x^{2}-\\cdots\\right)\\left(1+B x+\\frac{B(B-1)}{2} x^{2}+\\cdots\\right)=1-A x+\\frac{A(A-1)}{2} x^{2}+B x-A B x^{2}+\\frac{B(B-1)}{2} x^{2}+\\cdots=1-(A-B) x+\\left[\\frac{A(A-1)}{2}+\\frac{B(B-1)}{2}-A B\\right] x^{2}+\\cdots$. These will be the terms involving $1, x$ and $x^{2}$ in the final expansion of $f(x)$. Since $f(x)$ has a term $-2 x$ and no $x^{2}$ term, then $A-B=2$ and $\\frac{A(A-1)}{2}+\\frac{B(B-1)}{2}-A B=0$. The second equation becomes $A^{2}-A+B^{2}-B-2 A B=0$ or $(A-B)^{2}=A+B$. Since $A-B=2$, then $A+B=4$, whence $2 A=(A+B)+(A-B)=6$, so $A=3$ and $B=1$. Thus, the first two factors are $(1-x)^{3}(1+x)$. Note that $(1-x)^{3}(1+x)=\\left(1-3 x+3 x^{2}-x^{3}\\right)(1+x)=1-2 x+2 x^{3}-x^{4}$. Therefore, $f(x)=\\left(1-2 x+2 x^{3}-x^{4}\\right)\\left(1-x^{3}\\right)^{C}\\left(1-x^{4}\\right)^{D}\\left(1-x^{5}\\right)^{E}\\left(1-x^{6}\\right)^{F}$. The final result contains no $x^{3}$ term. Since the first factor contains a term '+2 x^{3}' which will appear in the final product by multiplying by all of the constant terms in subsequent factors, then this '+2 x^{3}' must be balanced by a '-2 x^{3}'. The only other factor possibly containing an $x^{3}$ is $\\left(1-x^{3}\\right)^{C}$. To balance the '+2 x^{3}' term, the expansion of $\\left(1-x^{3}\\right)^{C}$ must include a term '-2 x^{3}' which will be multiplied by the constant terms in the other factors to provide a '-2 x^{3}' in the final expansion, balancing the '+2 x^{3}'. For $\\left(1-x^{3}\\right)^{C}$ to include $-2 x^{3}$, we must have $C=2$, from $(*)$. Therefore, $f(x)=\\left(1-2 x+2 x^{3}-x^{4}\\right)\\left(1-x^{3}\\right)^{2}\\left(1-x^{4}\\right)^{D}\\left(1-x^{5}\\right)^{E}\\left(1-x^{6}\\right)^{F}=\\left(1-2 x+2 x^{3}-x^{4}\\right)\\left(1-2 x^{3}+x^{6}\\right)\\left(1-x^{4}\\right)^{D}\\left(1-x^{5}\\right)^{E}\\left(1-x^{6}\\right)^{F}=\\left(1-2 x+3 x^{4}-3 x^{6}+\\cdots\\right)\\left(1-x^{4}\\right)^{D}\\left(1-x^{5}\\right)^{E}\\left(1-x^{6}\\right)^{F}$. When we simplify at this stage, we can ignore any terms with exponent greater than 6, since we do not care about these terms and they do not affect terms with smaller exponents when we multiply out. To balance the '+3 x^{4}', the factor $\\left(1-x^{4}\\right)^{D}$ needs to include '-3 x^{4}' and so $D=3$. Therefore, $f(x)=\\left(1-2 x+3 x^{4}-3 x^{6}+\\cdots\\right)\\left(1-x^{4}\\right)^{3}\\left(1-x^{5}\\right)^{E}\\left(1-x^{6}\\right)^{F}=\\left(1-2 x+3 x^{4}-3 x^{6}+\\cdots\\right)\\left(1-3 x^{4}+\\cdots\\right)\\left(1-x^{5}\\right)^{E}\\left(1-x^{6}\\right)^{F}=\\left(1-2 x+6 x^{5}-3 x^{6}+\\cdots\\right)\\left(1-x^{5}\\right)^{E}\\left(1-x^{6}\\right)^{F}$. To balance the '+6 x^{5}', the factor $\\left(1-x^{5}\\right)^{E}$ needs to include '-6 x^{5}' and so $E=6$. Therefore, $f(x)=\\left(1-2 x+6 x^{5}-3 x^{6}+\\cdots\\right)\\left(1-x^{5}\\right)^{6}\\left(1-x^{6}\\right)^{F}=\\left(1-2 x+6 x^{5}-3 x^{6}+\\cdots\\right)\\left(1-6 x^{5}+\\cdots\\right)\\left(1-x^{6}\\right)^{F}=\\left(1-2 x+9 x^{6}+\\cdots\\right)\\left(1-x^{6}\\right)^{F}$. To balance the '+9 x^{6}', the factor $\\left(1-x^{6}\\right)^{F}$ needs to include '-9 x^{6}' and so $F=9$. We now know that $A=3, B=1, C=2, D=3, E=6$, and $F=9$. Since $D=d, E=f$, and $F=c$, then $c=9, f=6$, and $d=3$. Since $C=e-c, C=2$ and $c=9$, then $e=11$.

{"id": "4092", "category": null, "question": "\nThe objective of this problem is to devise a strategy for the illusionist and the assistant such that the illusionist can successfully determine the exact order of a hidden block of \\( k \\) consecutive balls. We will utilize the properties of permutations and lexicographic order to achieve this.\n\n### Problem Setup\n\nLet \\( k \\) be a positive integer and the number of balls \\( n = k! + k - 1 \\). The balls are numbered from 1 to \\( n \\), and they are arranged randomly by the spectator. The assistant's task is to select and hide a block of \\( k \\) consecutive balls and then use this block to communicate its order to the illusionist. The strategy involves encoding the order of the \\( k \\) balls using their lexicographic index and then having the illusionist decode this index.\n\n### Permutations and Lexicographic Index\n\n1. **Permutations of \\( k \\) Balls**: There are \\( k! \\) permutations of \\( k \\) balls. Each permutation can be uniquely identified by a lexicographic index ranging from 0 to \\( k! - 1 \\).\n   \n2. **Lexicographic Index**: The lexicographic index is an integer that reflects the position of a permutation in the list of all permutations ordered lexicographically. Specifically, for \\( k \\) distinct elements, this index is unique and provides one-to-one mapping between permutations and numbers from 0 to \\( k! - 1 \\).\n\n### Strategy Implementation\n\n#### Assistant's Task\n\n- **Encode the Permutation**: Once the assistant selects a block of \\( k \\) consecutive balls, she determines the permutation the balls represent.\n  \n- **Determine Lexicographic Index**: The assistant calculates the lexicographic index of this permutation. This index ranges from 0 to \\( k! - 1 \\). \n\n- **Positioning the Block**: The assistant then positions this block within the sequence of \\( n \\) balls such that the block's starting position modulo \\( k! \\) corresponds to the lexicographic index. Specifically, she aligns the starting point of this block of \\( k \\) balls such that its index \\( I \\) in the list of all permutations is reflected by:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Starting position of the block} = I \\mod n\n  \\]\n  \n  Since \\( n = k! + k - 1 \\), there are exactly \\( k! \\) distinct starting positions possible as \\( I \\) ranges from 0 to \\( k! - 1 \\).\n\n#### Illusionist's Task\n\n- **Decode the Position**: When the illusionist looks at the obscured sequence, he identifies the starting position of the covered block by interpreting the visible sequence.\n\n- **Determine the Permutation**: The illusionist computes:\n  \\[\n  \\text{Lexicographic index of the hidden permutation} = \\text{Starting position of the block} \\mod k!\n  \\]\n  \n  Using this lexicographic index, he can reconstruct the order of the \\( k \\) hidden balls accurately.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy systematically using the properties of permutations and lexicographic ordering, the assistant effectively communicates the hidden permutation through positioning, allowing the illusionist to determine the exact order confidently. Thus, the strategy ensures the magic trick works every time.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{The assistant encodes the permutation of the } k \\text{ balls using their lexicographic index and positions the block accordingly.

An effective strategy is alternating the placement of kings, akin to a checkerboard pattern but adapted to the constraints given.\n\n#### Step 1: Analyze the Pattern Layout\n\nTo satisfy condition (i) of no two kings sharing a common vertex, we need a pattern where each king is surrounded by non-attacking positions.
